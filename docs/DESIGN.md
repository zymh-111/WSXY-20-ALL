# 卫戍协议：盟约 — Web Remake · Architecture & Contracts (DESIGN.md)

This is the **single source of truth** for every implementer. Research lives in `docs/research/` (start with `00-INDEX.md`; where a research file's body and its "Addendum (critic)" disagree, the addendum wins). When this document and research disagree, **this document wins**; when this document is silent, follow research; when both are silent, choose the simplest faithful behaviour and write it down in the module's header comment.

Language: player-facing text is **Simplified Chinese** by default, with an English switch since 0.2.0 (§25.2, docs/I18N.md: UI strings through `t('中文')`, game texts from the official Chinese data or the official EN client's). Code, comments and identifiers are English.

Capacity branch: the upstream sections below document the original four-player scope. This branch's room capacity,
grouped pools, manual-player draft priority, multiple 联防 waves / votes and sidebar rules are in
[PLAYER_CAPACITY.md](PLAYER_CAPACITY.md). Leader HP uses the 0.2.1 per-player baseline up to 20 players and additionally
rescales on departure while preserving the current percentage; [D009](development/DECISIONS.md#d009) supersedes this
branch's earlier alive / 4 rule. Maintenance evidence is in [development/README.md](development/README.md).

Versions: the first public release was **0.1.0** (2026-10-02, the state of §0–§20.15); the releases after it add the player feedback and GitHub reports — 0.1.1 §21, 0.1.2 §22, 0.1.3 §23, 0.1.4 §24 — and **0.2.0** (2026-10-07; `CHANGELOG.md`) the maintainability refactor, two languages, 补位, 自选编队 and their fidelity work — §25 — **0.2.1** (2026-10-07) the 联防 battlefield restored, full potential and the GitHub fixes after it — §26 — and **0.2.2** (2026-10-09; `package.json`, `shared/constants.js APP_VERSION`) per-operator 潜能 / 练度, Japanese voices, the statistics page, 失衡, whole-frame attack timing and the GitHub fixes after 0.2.1 — §27, the state described by this document. The labels v1 / v2 / v2.1–v2.5.2 in §0, §14–§20 and in the BALANCE / SIM comparisons name the design generations and the private playtest builds that came before it; they are kept as history.

## Where each section lives

Section numbers are global and never change: code, tests and the other documents cite them as "DESIGN §N". The
current rules by area are in `docs/design/`, the per-release revisions (the evidence behind each rule) in
`docs/history/`. When a revision changes a rule, the rule in `docs/design/` is rewritten too (the revision lists the
normative lines it rewrote).
