# Assets: sources, layout, manifest, credits

Owner: `tools/fetch-assets.mjs` and `tools/assets/*`. Research background: `docs/research/07-assets.md`.

All art, Spine models and audio are **downloaded at install time**. They are never committed; `public/assets/` is git-ignored.
Everything the client needs is listed in **`data/assets.json`**. The client should only request URLs that appear in that manifest.

## Running

```bash
npm install          # also vendors pixi / pixi-spine / preact / three (tools/vendor.mjs; three.js is fetched by
                     # browsers only when data/local-assets.json lists the board atlas — the 3D board, DESIGN §15)
npm run assets       # = node tools/vendor.mjs && node tools/fetch-assets.mjs
```

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--concurrency=N` | Parallel downloads (default 16). |
| `--force` | Re-download everything. |
| `--offline` | No network. Re-runs post-processing (atlas fixes, skeleton parsing, WOFF2) on what is already on disk, then rebuilds `data/assets.json`. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the plan (file and model counts, alias notes) and exit. |
| `--refresh-index` | Re-download the upstream indexes: `audio_data.json`, `charword_table.json` (the 干员战斗语音 slots) and `models_data.json`. |
| `--voice-lang=cn` | The dub of `audio.voice` (the 中文 voice setting): `cn` (default) | `jp` | `en` | `kr` — the same file names under `voice_cn/`, `voice/`, `voice_en/`, `voice_kr/`. `audio.voiceJp` (the 日本語 setting) is always the JP dub: every run plans both trees. |
| `--voice-all` | Plan every official voice slot, including the prep-only lines no battle plays (干员报到 / 编入队伍 / 任命队长 — 360 files, one per operator and slot). Off by default: nothing requests them, so planning them only makes every run download more. |
| `--prune` | Delete files under `public/assets/` that the manifest no longer references, for example after a mapping change. Without this flag they are only listed in the report. `public/assets/local/` (written by `tools/local-extract`) is never pruned. Implies `--allow-shrink`. |
| `--allow-shrink` | Write `data/assets.json` even when it loses entries the current one has (see "The manifest never shrinks by accident" below). |
| `--add-only` | For a checkout whose `public/assets/` and `public/fonts/` are shared with another one (a git worktree with symlinked asset folders): download only the files missing on disk and never re-download, rewrite or delete an existing file — atlases already on disk are left as they are, the fonts are not rebuilt (the manifest keeps its current `fonts`). Not with `--prune` / `--force`. |
| `--local-spines` | Rewrite `tools/assets/local-enemy-spines.json` and `tools/assets/local-token-spines.json` (the metadata of the enemy and token models only the local client has, see "Enemy aliases" and "Token models from the local client") from the models `tools/local-extract/extract.py` extracted to `public/assets/local/spine/enemy/` and `public/assets/local/spine/token/`. Run it after a game update changed them; without it the committed files are used and a differing extraction only gets a warning. |

**The manifest never shrinks by accident.** An entry whose files are missing on this machine is left out of a rebuilt
manifest, so a run where some downloads failed (or whose upstream audio / model index lost them) would drop entries that
every other install still has from the committed `data/assets.json` (a pull request once carried such a manifest, 42
audio entries short — all 42 still resolve upstream; PR #7). When the rebuilt manifest lacks an entry of the current
one, the run keeps the current file, prints the entries it would drop (also in the report: `droppedEntries`,
`manifestWritten: false`) and exits 1. Re-run to retry the downloads, or pass `--allow-shrink` (or `--prune`) when the
smaller manifest is intended, for example after a mapping change. Build fields (`version`, `hash`, `generator`,
`stats`), new entries and a changed value are never a drop (`tools/assets/manifest.mjs droppedEntries`). A run whose
plan legitimately narrows — like the 干员战斗语音 default, which no longer plans the three prep-only slots (360 entries,
DESIGN §21.30) — reports exactly those entries and needs `--allow-shrink` once; the list it prints is the check.

The script is **idempotent**. A file on disk is kept, not re-downloaded, when any one of these holds:
- its size matches the ledger entry from a previous download (`.cache/assets-ledger.json`);
- its size matches the byte count recorded in research;
- no size is known, but the file passes format validation. Validation checks the PNG signature and `IEND`, the MP3 header, the sfnt header, the atlas page line, and that a skel is not an HTML error page.

Every download is written to a temp file, then renamed into place. A partial download therefore never reaches its final path.

How downloads are fetched:
- 16 connections at a time.
- Each source gets 3 attempts with exponential backoff.
- If `raw.githubusercontent.com` fails, the jsDelivr mirror (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/…`) is tried.
- There is no mirror for the ArknightsAssets2 `voice` branch, because jsDelivr returns 404 for it.
- A manifest entry with fallbacks (for example an enemy icon that falls back to its base enemy's icon) only moves on to the next alternative after a **definitive 404**. When the primary fails transiently (network error, 5xx or an invalid payload after all retries), no fallback is fetched. The path is listed under `downloadErrors` in the report, and the next run retries the primary.
- A skeleton that fails to parse is deleted and removed from the ledger, so the next online run downloads it again.

The first run downloads about **548 MiB in 10,643 files** (`stats` of `data/assets.json` in 0.2.2: 574,449,900 bytes). The two 干员战斗语音 dubs are 2,674 files each, the twelve slots a battle plays for 191 operators: the Chinese one 65.6 MiB, the Japanese one 85.2 MiB (89,388,041 bytes; adding it took 107 s at about 1 MB/s from raw.githubusercontent.com). A re-run takes about 1 s. The three prep-only slots the official client uses elsewhere (干员报到 / 编入队伍 / 任命队长, 360 more files per dub, 18.4 MiB of them Chinese) are left out unless `--voice-all` is passed.

Outputs:
- `data/assets.json`: the manifest (committed).
- `public/assets/**`: art and audio (git-ignored).
- `public/fonts/*`: fonts and `fonts.css`.
- `.cache/assets-report.json`: misses, fallbacks and notes from the last run.
- `.cache/spine-info.json`: skeleton parse cache.

The run exits with code 1 if any pool operator is missing its avatar, its portrait or its Front Spine.

Upstream indexes are cached under `.cache/`. They are downloaded when missing:
- `.cache/gamedata/excel/audio_data.json`, from `Kengxxiao/ArknightsGameData` (zh_CN).
- `.cache/ark-models/models_data.json`, from `isHarryh/Ark-Models`.

The research JSONs in `docs/research/` (03, 05, 07) define **which** ids are needed.

The `stem` of a Spine model is the upstream file name. Two examples: `char_107_liskam` has the stem `char_107_liskarm`, and `enemy_9032_aclionk` uses `enemy_1559_vtlionk`. The skel and atlas of a model always share one stem. pixi-spine locates the atlas by swapping the extension, so this matters.

### Id scope

- **Operators:** all 138 pool charIds from `activity_table` (`charShopChessDatas[*].charId ∪ backupCharId`), including hidden chess and backup operators; plus every unit of `data/backups.json` research 07 does not list — the 71 自选 owned-6★ picks (`diy.ownedPool`, DATA.md §18; the collab operators are not in the data, and 焰狐龙梓兰's entries left the manifest when she left the pool in 0.2.0) — planned from 07's URL patterns (`tools/assets/plan.mjs patternOperator`, `tools/fetch-assets.mjs dataExtras`): avatar and portrait (E0–E1 and E2), the default-skin battle Spine Front / Back, the icon and skill sound of each skill, the sub-profession icon. 209 operators in all (206 with a Back model).
- **Tokens:** the 20 pool tokens, and the 38 summons of the 自选 picks (`data/backups.json tokens`) as extra tokens (below): their avatars; no dump carries the battle Spine of the 自选 summons (upstream has at most skin variants, which the default locations miss), so the web manifest has no model for them — 35 of them, and 4 pool summons, have the official model as an optional local-client overlay ("Token models from the local client"); 3 have no model in the game at all.
- **Enemies:** 253 ids planned, 252 in the manifest (心烛 has no assets). The set is the union of:
  - the 07 enemy list;
  - every enemy in the `act1autochess_*` wave, boss and 联防 levels that act2 modes use (from `05-maps.json`; the tutorial is excluded);
  - the bosses (`boss_1..10`);
  - the closure of their summons (`randomEnemyAttribute` spawns and blackboard `enemy_key` references);
  - every key of `data/enemies.json` (built by `tools/build-data.mjs`, when present), which adds for example the enemies swapped in by 机变 effects;
  - the bosses' handbook/model ids, such as `enemy_1559_vtlionk`;
  - enemy units spawned by operator kits (research 03 skills/talents). For example, 隐德来希's default S3 summons 心烛 `enemy_5601_entlec` through the talent key `take_extra_enemy_key`. 心烛 has no icon and no Spine in any dump, so it has no manifest entry: it is reported as a miss, and the client must draw a glyph.
- **Extra tokens:** any `token_*` key of `data/tokens.json` that research does not list gets the default avatar and Spine locations.
  - The non-token summons in that file (`enemy_9012_acloon` 炎佑, `char_605_cmedic`, `char_613_acmedc`) are found under `enemies` and `chars`.
- **Skill icons:** every skill index of every planned operator (the default one first; DESIGN §16 loadouts, the 自选 picks' three skills): 522 icons.
- **UI:**
  - every group from `07-assets.json → autochessUi`: rarity, elite and chess-level sprites, the shop panel and cards, HUD, bond board, equip slot, round dialog, band choose, settlement, prepare backdrop;
  - `arts` (rarity stars, elite icons, the camp logos of pool nations, the loading illustrations used by the act2 modes, battle common sprites, act2 entry backdrops and season logo, item rarity frames);
  - extras (`tools/assets/plan.mjs UI_EXTRAS`): mode choice art, battle-ready backdrops, battle UI (speed, pause, HP slider, attack range, boss avatar frame, skill ready), `empty_skill`, the 机变 panel and cards, the equip-replace dialog, the bond detail dialog, the prep-ready panel, stage-info titles, the 36 battle emotes (`emoticon/{dir}/{picId}`) and the 19 玩法说明 pages (`guide/{key}`) — these two keyed by the group and name of `data/local-assets.json`.

## Post-processing

- **Atlases** (research 07 §5.3):
  - Insert `size: W,H` right after each page name. fexli atlases omit it; the value is read from the PNG header. An existing size that disagrees with the PNG is corrected.
  - Ark-Models enemy atlases get `pma: true`, because their textures are premultiplied. pixi-spine reads this and sets `ALPHA_MODES.PMA`.
  - Page names are sanitized to safe file names.
  - All of this is idempotent.
- **Skeletons:** every `.skel` (Spine 3.8.99 binary) is parsed in Node with `@pixi-spine/runtime-3.8`, the parser the client ships.
  - The parse extracts animation names and durations, event names, `OnAttack` times per animation, and bounds.
  - Attachment paths are checked against the atlas regions.
  - Then the animation-role resolver runs. See `tools/assets/anim-roles.mjs` and research 07 §5.4.
  - A web enemy model whose clip names mislead the resolver gets the roles of its official battle prefab
    (`tools/assets/spine.mjs PREFAB_SPINE_ROLES`, read from the local client's `battle/enm_pfb_*.ab`: the prefab's anim
    key → clip table and the clip its Spine starts on): 普通囚犯 / 老练囚犯 start on their grey `*3` set (【禁锢】), not
    the unnumbered red one (【解放】) the names point to.
- **Fonts:** OTF/TTF files are converted to WOFF2 by a built-in encoder (`tools/assets/woff2.mjs`: Brotli with null transforms).
  - Its output was verified lossless against Google's reference `woff2` decoder.
  - `fonts.css` lists WOFF2 first and falls back to the original file.
- Images stay PNG. WebP conversion is not done: it would need a native dependency. The local-client board textures are the exception: `tools/local-extract/extract.py` (Python, where Pillow is already a dependency) writes WebP copies of the 12 textures the 3D board downloads (`WEBP`: colour maps lossy at quality 95 with the alpha and the RGB under transparent texels kept, normal and data maps lossless) and `data/local-assets.json` lists the copies; the PNGs stay beside them for `tools/crop-board-atlas.mjs`. `extract.py --webp` adds the copies to an existing extraction without the client.

## Manifest schema (`data/assets.json`)

All paths are URL paths relative to the site root, for example `/assets/char/avatar/char_002_amiya.png`. **Only entries whose files exist on disk are emitted.** When a key is missing, the client should use its fallback (research 07 §5.6).

  fonts: { css: '/fonts/fonts.css', faces: { [name]: { family, weight, woff2?, original } } }
}
```

### The `Spine` object

```js
{
  skel, atlas, textures: [url],       // load with PIXI.Assets.load(skel); atlas/png sit next to it
  pma: boolean,                       // true for enemies (atlas already carries `pma: true`)
  anims: Roles,                       // resolved roles, below
  animations: { [name]: seconds },    // every animation with its duration
  events: [name],                     // e.g. ['OnAttack', 'OnStart']
  hits: { [animName]: [seconds] },    // OnAttack event times (apply damage / spawn projectile)
  bounds: { x, y, width, height } | null  // skeleton AABB (setup pose, skeleton units)
}
```

The enemies' attack clip lengths are also a data input: `tools/build-data.mjs` copies each enemy model's
`anims.attack.loop` length and first `hits` time into data/enemies.json `attackAnim` (the sim stands an unblocked
ranged enemy for that clip, GitHub #58, and strikes every enemy attack at that frame, 0.2.0; docs/DATA.md §9) — rebuild the data after a manifest change that touches them.

### The `Roles` object

```js
Clip      = { begin: string|null, loop: string, end: string|null, via?: 'combat'|'attackAny'|'skill'|'idle'|'attack' }
SkillClip = Clip & { index: number /* 0-based skill index */, idle: string|null /* Skill_n_Idle */ }
Roles = {
  idle: string, deploy: string,
  attack: Clip,            // play begin once, loop per attack, end when stopping; `via:'idle'` ⇒ add a flash
  attackDown: Clip|null,   // _Down variants (target below the unit)
  skill: SkillClip|null,   // for the chess's default skill (primary index)
  skills?: { [index]: SkillClip },   // when the char is used with several default skills (backups); an enemy: every
                           //   numbered skill clip (Skill_01..04 of 盐风主教昆图斯 — the slot a sim `cast` event names, PR #275)
  die: string|null,        // null ⇒ a Back model gives way to the Front model's Die (DESIGN §22.1); any other
                           //   skeleton holds its idle's first frame while it fades out
  move: Clip|null,         // enemies: Move_Begin|Move_Start + Move_Loop|Move + Move_End → Run_*
  run?: Clip,              // the model's own Run cycle (Run_Begin/Loop/End): an enemy faster than moveSpeed 1 moves on it
  stun: Clip|null          // Stun | Stun_1 | Dizzy_Loop (+ *_Begin / *_End); null ⇒ freeze the track (timeScale 0)
}
```

`via` marks a fallback:

| `via` | The attack is actually… |
|---|---|
| `combat` | `Combat` |
| `attackAny` | a numbered attack such as `Attack_01`, possibly framed by `Attack_Begin`/`Attack_End` (`char_1045_svash2`) |
| `skill` | `Skill_1_Loop` (pure supporters) |
| `idle` | `Idle` (no attack animation at all) |

On a skill clip, `via: 'attack'` means the model has no skill animation, so the attack clip is reused.
A skill clip may also come from directional-only animations when a model has no undirected ones: for example `Skill_Right_Loop` (`char_279_excu`) or `Skill_Loop_Up` (the Back model of `char_431_ashlok`).

The resolver's full precedence list is in the header of `tools/assets/anim-roles.mjs`.

The manifest roles describe a unit's first form. Units whose skeleton holds another form's clip set get it from
`public/js/render/units.js FORMS` (keyed by Spine id, switched by the `form` of the sim's 'phase' / 'ember' / 'revive'
/ 'telegraph' / 'stone' / 'liberate' / 'substitute' / 'swap' / 'dollEnd' fx — `shared/protocol.js fxForm`; no client stage drops these fx: the runner keeps them through
catch-up frames and hidden tabs (`keepsState`), the game screen's pre-entry buffer (`keepEarly`) and the render engine's
event queue (`render/interp.js isCosmeticEvent`) too — or, for a view built mid-battle, UnitInfo `form`, which `render/app/info.js renderInfo` passes to the view; a
`change` clip plays once first, an `end` clip is timed from the fx's `dur` to finish as that state ends, keeping the
current form's death clip until the next form's fx). A blocked or revealed 隐匿 enemy is drawn solid: the sim sends the
stealth bit only while its 隐匿 is on — and 假想敌：骨刺 changes model with that bit, not with an fx (`STEALTH_FORMS`, GitHub
#296, PR #365): the manifest's `*_A` (the three-headed snake) while the bit is on, its `*_B` set (form `revealed`) the
moment it is blocked or revealed, `*_A` again when its 隐匿 is back; no change clip, a running attack, stun or freeze
pose carried over (`render/spine.js syncFormPose`). The forms:
- 掠海漂移体's crawl (`Change`, then `*_02`);
- 假想敌：骨刺 (`*_A` / `*_B`, above);
- 转译基底·α's three forms (`A_Die_B` / `_C` / `_D`, 2 s each, then `B_*` 寻仇者, `C_*` 幽灵, `D_*` 特战术师);
- the 深池逐火 embers (`Die`, then `Idle_2` / `Move_2` / `Die_2`; `Revive` ends as it stands up) and 假想敌：再生's puppet
  (`A_Die`, then `B_*`; `B_Revive`);
- the leaders' 重生: 锏 (`Revive1`, `Revive2` held, `Revive3`, then `B_*`), 扎罗 (`A_revive_1` / `_2` / `_3`, then `B_*`),
  “复仇者” (`Revive_Begin` / `_Loop` / `_End`), 杰斯顿 (`C1_Die`, then `C2_*`);
- 守墓石像 (the statue on `Sleep` [ASSUMED by name], then the flyer's `*_2`).
- the 孤岛风云 prisoners, as their official prefabs' modes: confined on the manifest's grey set, `warning` (mode R, the
  warning before the last confined attack) on the blinking orange set, `liberty` (【解放】) on the red set — 普通囚犯 /
  老练囚犯 `Idle3` → `Idle2` → `Idle`, 强壮囚犯 `Idle` → `Idle2` → `Idle3`, 拳师囚犯 / 重犯 / 传奇重犯 `*_grey` → `*_orange` →
  `*_red` (Move / Attack / Die alike; no change clip).
- the 傀儡师 operators' <替身> (form `doll` of the sim's 'substitute' / 'swap' / 'dollEnd' fx, DESIGN §22.11; the `*_B`
  clips draw the 替身's own slots and hide the 本体's): 归溟幽灵鲨 `Start_B` (it fades in), `Idle_B`, `Die_B` over its last
  second (it breaks apart and fades), `Die_B_2` when it is knocked out (it collapses), and the 本体 back on `Start_2` (a
  form's `leave` clip); 风丸 `Start_B`, `Idle_B` / `Attack_B` / `Die_B`, the 本体 back on `Start`. Facing up, 归溟幽灵鲨's
  Back skeleton has only `Idle_B` and `Start_2`, 风丸's `Start_B`, `Idle_B` and `Attack_B`: the missing clips are skipped.
  Neither Back skeleton has the 替身's death clip, so a 替身 knocked out lies on the Front model (like every knocked-out
  operator facing up, DESIGN §22.1) with its `Die_B_2` / `Die_B`: the view keeps the form it died in for that model and
  for one rebuilt while it lies down, although the sim resets the form right after the knock-out.

Not mapped (clip names ambiguous): “自在”, “巨大的丑东西”, 主角阵营角色 and “余音” (`*_A` / `*_B`: which of its two forms is A
is not known) keep their manifest clips.

Other renderer rules from research 07 §5.4–5.5:
- **Choosing the model:** Front when the unit faces right or down; Front mirrored when facing left; Back when facing up — while it stands: a dead or knocked-out operator falls and lies with the Front model unless its Back skeleton has a Die clip of its own (131 of the 135 have none; DESIGN §22.1, GitHub issue #25).
- **Attack speed:** set the attack `timeScale` to `duration / attackInterval`.
- **Model size:** every skeleton is drawn at one `UNIT.modelScale` (render/style.js, 320 skeleton units per tile), which stands for the official standard. The official client also scales each enemy model in its battle prefab: the Graphic / FaceSwitcher / Spine transforms multiply to 0.27 for most enemies and for the operators' battle skins, but not for all of them. For example, 威龙 is 0.16, 妖怪 0.20 and 青铜镜 0.6. The skeletons themselves carry no such scale, because every enemy SkeletonDataAsset uses 0.01. So an enemy is drawn × data/enemies.json `modelScale` (its prefab's product ÷ 0.27, see docs/DATA.md; user playtest #6: 威龙 used to be drawn 1.35× a 妖怪 instead of 1.08×), and its HP bar sits on that model: at its setup-pose bounds' height × the same factors, or, for a skeleton without bounds, at the chibi headroom × `modelScale` (bosses 2.2 tiles). `tools/local-extract/enemy_scales.py` reads the products from a local client, and `tools/build-data.mjs MODEL_SCALES` keeps them. Two prefab quirks on top (PR #211 by @xcdoge; the owner's decision of 2026-10-06; docs/research/12 §3.1): the two 帝国炮火先兆者 are stretched vertically (`modelScaleY` 1.263: their Graphic scale is (0.19, 0.24, 0.24)) and 木制瑞印 is mirrored (`mirrorX`: a negative Graphic X scale) — `tools/local-extract/enemy_model_offsets.py` reads them, `tools/build-data.mjs MODEL_STRETCH_Y` / `MIRRORED_PREFABS` keep them.
- **Flying units** hover `FLY_HOVER` = 1.3 tiles up (render/units.js; the client's single fly offset 0.35 in its character space, whose unit is the standard prefab scale 0.27 — docs/research/12) — an enemy flyer above the road whatever tile it crosses (a high-ground or forbidden block under it is no step, GitHub #277), an operator or summon above its tile: the body, its HP bar, damage numbers and hits ride the lift, the shadow stays on the ground tile (the block top under an enemy flyer crossing one), on the 2D and the 3D board alike (one camera drives both).
- **Enemy aliases:** `enemies[id].spineAliasOf` means the model belongs to another enemy. Two cases:
  - `_2` variants whose official prefab is the base one (鸭爵, 高普尼克, 流泪小子, 圆仔, 假想敌：胄, 假想敌：铳): the base model, as in the game.
  - an enemy whose own model no dump carries: 灼热源石虫 / 炽焰源石虫 (`enemy_1305_mhslim` / `_2`) use the plain 源石虫 on
    the web (`plan.mjs ENEMY_SPINE_ALIAS`). The reason is upstream: isHarryh/Ark-Models *indexes* `1305_mhslim` /
    `1305_mhslim_2` but with an **empty `assetList`** — registered, never uploaded — so `arkModel()` finds no files for
    them and the alias chain drops to `enemy_1007_slime`, a different enemy rather than a variant of it, which is why
    the renderer tints that alias toward the slug's own colours. Their official skeletons only exist in the client's
    enemy art bundles (`refs/arts/enm_art_*.ab`); the *mobile* build also ships them as
    `enemy_spine/<enemyId>/<enemyId>.{skel,atlas,png}` (straight-alpha pages: no `pma: true` line), but its only public
    mirror is a community wiki rather than a GitHub dump, so it is deliberately **not** an asset source — a third-party
    site is not added to `sources.mjs` for two models, and the tinted alias stays the web model until a GitHub dump
    carries them. The same official model from the local client is the optional **overlay**,
    `enemies[id].spineLocal` = `{ group, skel, atlas, textures, pma, anims, animations, events, hits, bounds }` (file
    names in the `data/local-assets.json` group `spine/enemy/{enemyId}`; the rest as a `spine` entry):
    - `tools/local-extract/extract.py` writes the model to `public/assets/local/spine/enemy/{enemyId}/` (page textures
      with their `[alpha]` texture merged in: premultiplied RGB + A like Ark-Models; the atlas gets `size:` and
      `pma: true`) and lists its files in `data/local-assets.json`.
    - The metadata comes from the committed `tools/assets/local-enemy-spines.json` (`fetch-assets --local-spines`
      parses the extracted models into it), never from the disk: `data/assets.json` is byte-identical with or without
      the extraction, it has no `/assets/local/` URL, and setup / doctor / the manifest tests never miss these files.
    - The client (`assets.js spineEntry`, with `assets.local()`, which `createFieldView` awaits with the manifest) draws
      the official model when the local manifest lists every file of it; otherwise, or when it fails to load
      (`UnitView`: the entry's `fallback`), the web alias, tinted toward the slug's own lava colours
      (`render/units.js ALIAS_TINT`: 灼热 orange, 炽焰 red-orange; research 07 §5.6 "a hue shift", [ASSUMED] look) so a
      source install without the extraction still tells them from the plain 源石虫. A release bundle carries the
      models only when it is zipped from a checkout where the extraction ran with the `spine/enemy` job (an extraction
      made with 0.1.0 lacks it: `node tools/setup.mjs --local` again, then check that `data/local-assets.json` lists
      `spine/enemy/enemy_1305_mhslim` and `spine/enemy/enemy_1305_mhslim_2`).
    User feedback after 0.1.0 (D3: "所有特殊源石虫的模型全表现为普通源石虫"): the ELEMENT faction spawns up to ten of them a
    round. A 2026-10-03 audit of every enemy of `data/enemies.json` (249) against the client's battle prefabs (the
    skeleton each prefab's Spine renderer draws) found no other enemy drawn with another enemy's model; 伊利昂的木驮兽
    (`enemy_10159_mntrjn`) starts on its `Full` skin (five passengers) in the game and is drawn with the `default` one.
- **Token models from the local client** (0.2.0): no dump carries the battle Spine of most 自选 summons (fetch-assets:
  "missing skel"), nor of 凯瑟琳's 爬行号·防护单元 and 凛御银灰's 风雪之眼, so they were drawn as the avatar diamond. The
  local client has them in its battle token packs (`pkgrps/btl_pfb_tokens_*.ab`, the Windows build carries all of them;
  the iOS build lacks `btl_pfb_tokens_0` and has ASTC pages), the same overlay as the enemies above:
  - `tools/local-extract/extract.py TOKEN_SPINES` (39 ids; `--only spine/token`) reads each token's battle prefab
    (`dyn/battle/prefabs/[uc]tokens/<id>.prefab`), takes the skeleton of its Front renderer — a directional token has
    Front / Back (/ Down) renderers, each with its own skeleton of the same name; the web tokens use Front too — and
    writes it to `public/assets/local/spine/token/{tokenId}/` like an enemy model (skeleton, sized `pma: true` atlas,
    premultiplied pages: the older tokens' `[alpha]` texture merged in, the newer RGBA pages kept with their own alpha).
  - `tokens[id].spineLocal` = `{ group: 'spine/token/{tokenId}', skel, atlas, textures, pma, anims, … }` from the
    committed `tools/assets/local-token-spines.json` (`fetch-assets --local-spines`), never from the disk;
    `assets.js spineEntry` draws the model when `data/local-assets.json` lists every file of it, else (or when it fails
    to load) the avatar diamond as before. The models are drawn like the web tokens: one `UNIT.modelScale`, no
    per-prefab factor (the official prefabs scale most tokens by the standard 0.27; W's 此面向敌 0.4, 令's “清平” 0.25 and
    “弦惊” 0.3, 傀影's 镜中虚影 0.26, 风雪之眼 and 淬羽赫默's 夜灯 0.25 — like the web tokens' 医疗探机 / 诅咒娃娃 0.4 and
    香槟炸弹 0.25).
  - Clip names the resolver cannot read are mapped in `tools/assets/spine.mjs LOCAL_SPINE_ROLES`: 电弧's 戴乌
    (`C_Skill1_*`, beside a 0 s `C_Default` pose), 酒神's 本能的召唤 (`Loop` / `End`) and 白铁's 多功能平台 (`End` as it
    goes) [ASSUMED: by the clip names], and 凯尔希·思衡托's 战术锚点, whose Start / Idle / Die clips hide its only
    attachment: it stays on its `Default` pose (a white anchor mark) [ASSUMED].
  - Not extracted: the tokens whose prefab draws nothing (an `EmptyAnimator` instead of a Spine renderer; no avatar in
    either install's asset index either): 乌尔比安's 从不混淆的方向, 圣聆初雪's 保护目标（冻结状态）, 酒神's 迷狂牢笼, 贝洛内's
    牵绊 and 予愿安洁莉娜's “一会儿见！” — the last three keep the token fallback picture (`tokenAvatarUrl`: no avatar, no
    owner in the manifest → the 召唤物 battle-card icon).

### Other fallbacks

- **Emotes and 玩法说明 pages** (`public/js/data.js artUrls / nextArtUrl`, `ui/guide.js guideStage`): the local-client picture (`data/local-assets.json`) first, then the mirror copy (`ui['emoticon/…']`, `ui['guide/…']`), each tried in turn when one fails to load; when none is left — none listed, or every copy failed (for example data/assets.json lists the downloaded pages but the files are not on disk yet: a `git pull` and restart without setup) — the neutral emote glyph, and for a page the official tips text (`config.tips`). The rest of the local-client art (the 3D board, the official HUD sprites, module type icons, the two enemy models and the 39 token models above) is not downloaded: the client looks it up in `data/local-assets.json` only (most of the HUD sprites are on the mirror too, DESIGN §22.5); docs/DEPLOY.md §6 lists what falls back without it.
- **Tokens:**
  - Without an avatar, use `chars[owner].avatar` with a 召唤物 badge, or `prof.battlecard.token` — except 圣聆初雪's 保护目标（冻结状态） (PRTS 无头像; the frozen gate), drawn as a procedural ice diamond (`render/units.js ICE_TOKENS`).
  - Without a Spine (and without its local-client model, "Token models from the local client"), draw the avatar sprite with a bob tween.
  - `spineVariant` names the skin-variant model that stands in for the missing default model.
- **Enemies without a spine** (for example `enemy_9016_acstmr`): draw `icon` in a diamond. Enemies with no manifest entry at all (`enemy_5601_entlec` 心烛): draw a procedural glyph.
- **Battle effects** (projectiles per kind, hit sparks and slashes, skill bursts and auras, 蕾缪安's lock reticles and shells, 回环射手 boomerangs — DESIGN §17.3) are procedural: the FX atlas is drawn at run time (`public/js/render/textures.js`), so they need no downloaded or local art. The local client does have battle effect art — `battle/[pack]common.ab` holds per-weapon projectile sprites (`projectile_arrow(_new)`, `projectile_crossbow(_new)`, `projectile_yuki`, `img_fx_light_01/02`, `trail_11`), and the per-character `battle/prefabs/effects/*.ab` are particle systems whose textures live in other bundles — but none of it is extracted: the sim's `arrow` also covers gun snipers, and friends joining a game may not have the local art.
- **Spine memory** (`public/js/assets.js`): skeletons are refcounted in an LRU with an idle budget (`SPINE_IDLE_BYTES`, 48 MB) and a 15 s grace; eviction runs `SPINE_EVICT_DELAY_MS` (1 s) after a release, the "no scene on screen" budget (0 bytes) applies after `SPINE_QUIET_DELAY_MS` (3 s) with nothing referenced, and a skeleton whose unload is still in flight is never handed out again — a new load waits for the unload (DESIGN §17.1; it used to leave operators invisible after a battle → prep switch).

### Looking up `data/chess.json` asset ids

`data/chess.json` stores asset **ids** in `chess[*].assets` (docs/DATA.md). They map onto this manifest as follows (checked for all 258 chess):

| `assets` field | Example id | Manifest URL |
|---|---|---|
| `avatar` | `char_498_inside` / `char_498_inside_2` | `chars[id].avatar` / `chars[id minus "_2"].avatarE2` |
| `portrait` | `char_498_inside_1` / `char_498_inside_2` | `chars[id minus "_1"].portrait` / `chars[id minus "_2"].portraitE2` |
| `spine` | `char_498_inside` | `chars[id].spine.front` (and `.back`) |
| `skillIcon` | `skchr_inside_2` | `skills[id]` (the id is the skill's `iconId`) |
| `subProfIcon` | `sub_fastshot_icon` | `prof.sub[id minus "sub_" and "_icon"]` |
- **Missing unit SFX:** use `audio.sfx.battle.enemyHit` or a WebAudio blip (research 07 §6.4).
- **Bond icons:** if the real glyph ever fails, the stored file is the nation camp logo.

## Verification

`node --test test/assets.test.js` covers the pure helpers: the resolver, the atlas normalizer, the format sniffers, WOFF2, audio banks, the plan id sets, the downloader against a fake network, and the self-heal of corrupt skeletons.
When `public/assets` exists, the same file also checks the generated output:
- Every manifest path exists on disk.
- Every pool operator has an avatar, a portrait and a Front model.
- Every atlas has `size:` lines, plus `pma: true` for enemies.
- Every Spine model loads the way the client loads it — the local-client enemy and token models too, when `data/local-assets.json` lists them. That means pixi-spine's atlas reader with real page sizes, where a region outside its page throws, then `SkeletonBinary` with `AtlasAttachmentLoader`, where a missing region throws. Every resolved role is then posed.

`test/feedback1d-models.test.js` (enemies) and `test/local-token-models.test.js` (tokens) check the local-client overlays: the plan, the committed metadata, the manifest without `/assets/local/` URLs, the client's choice of model; `test/local-extract.test.js` the extractor's job table and helpers.

The 2026-09-27 verification pass also checked:
- **PNG:** all 2,211 PNGs pass a full CRC and inflate check.
- **Audio:** all 467 MP3s decode with ffmpeg without errors.
- **Browser:** headless Chrome loads and animates all 529 Spine models with the vendored PixiJS 7.4.2 and pixi-spine 4.0.6, with no console errors. Chrome's font sanitizer also accepts the three WOFF2 files.
- **Official data:** 771 provenance checks against the official data (`activity_table`, `skill_table`, `models_data.json`) all match: avatars, portraits, E2 art, bond, band and item icons, and enemy skeleton files.
