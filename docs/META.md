# META.md — match & meta engine (server/match)

Audience: **content authors** writing prep-side ("SERVER_*") effects in `server/sim/content/*.js → registerMeta(registry)`,
the **UI owner** consuming `m.public` / `m.private` / `m.result`, and anyone driving matches in tests or tools.
Normative contracts stay in DESIGN.md §6 and §8 ([design/match.md](design/match.md),
[design/network.md](design/network.md)); this file documents the implementation and every assumption it makes.

**Deploy field (user playtest #5 item 7).** From the ROUND_START of a boss round (最终攻势 / 隐秘核心) a player deploys on
its half of the boss field (`Match.deployFieldOf` → `'bossL'`, or `'bossR'` for the second player of a seat pair — the
same pairing as the fields, `bossWaves` / `Match.bossGroupOf`, planned in `startRound` BEFORE the players' round start
so R14 → R15 never re-checks a boss-half board against the normal field, and re-paired — with an immediate re-check —
when a teammate quits before the fight): `board.js buildDeployMap`
reads the stage tile (r − 7, c) / mirrored (r − 7, 20 − c) under every board tile (r, c) (official
ConvertChessPositionInfoToBossMap, player_map_ud_offset 7) and that half's devices under the player's overrides. Board
coordinates never change (g.move, the battle input). A change of the deploy field re-checks the board like a terrain
change (`PlayerState.deployMap` → `_evictIllegal`; the read-only checker `invariants.js` uses the pure
`Match.deployMapFor`); on the data's 11 stages everything legal on the normal board is legal on both boss halves (and
the two halves have the same classes), and the boss halves add act2 m01's fenced tiles (board (10–12, 8)), which stay
legal from R14 into R15. The client mirrors it
(`ui/gameLogic.js deployFieldOf` / `placementContext({ field })`); the bot plans on the same map.

| Timer (real s, × `opts.timerScale`) | Value |
|---|---|
| INFO_CHECK | `config.timers.infoCheck` 25 |
| band draft turn | `Match.BAND_TURN_SECONDS` 30 [ASSUMED] (= `timers.bandTurn`), the step's only countdown: `m.public.deadline` = the current turn's end, no step cap (`timers.bandDraft` 50 = the official whole step, informational) (co-op; solo / single human untimed) |
| BATTLE_CHECK | `battleCheck` 3 |
| 机变 first / other pickers | `spFirst` 30 / `spTurn` 16 (co-op; solo / single human untimed) |
| PREP | `modes[m].rounds[r].prepTime` (co-op; solo / single human untimed) |
| COMBAT / 联防 | `modes[m].rounds[r].combatTimeLimit` (= the level's `maxPlayTime`) real seconds = 2× that in game seconds |
| 最终攻势 / 隐秘核心 | no hard stop: countdown `rounds[r].levelMaxPlayTime` 120 real s; overtime drain from `bossOvertimeAfter` 150 real s, 1 team LP per real s (§3) |
| ROUND_START / after combat / SETTLE | 2 / 1.5 / 3 (presentation delays, `Match.DELAYS`) |
| bot action delay | 0.9 s (+0.35 s per seat) |

A match with a single human seat at the start (独立模拟, or a 同盟 room started alone / with AI teammates only:
`Match.loneHuman` → `Match.soloUntimed`, user playtest #4 item 3) times nothing outside its battles: no INFO_CHECK /
band draft / 机变 / PREP deadline, and BATTLE_CHECK / ROUND_START / SETTLE run silently (deadline 0); the co-op rules
(draft order and skip, 6 机变 cards, 联防) stay.
`m.public.deadline` is the absolute end of the current timer (ms epoch, 0 = untimed; combat: estimated end at 2×;
最终攻势 / 隐秘核心: the boss level's `levelMaxPlayTime` countdown, 120 real s — the battle goes on past it — with
`m.public.overtimeAt` = when the overtime drain starts, 150 real s; both on the field clock).

### 1.1 Band draft
Co-op: random order (all seats, bots included), one pick per turn, ONE countdown: `BAND_TURN_SECONDS` 30 s per turn,
published as `m.public.deadline` (= `draft.turnDeadline`; `draft.turnSeconds` its length) — no step cap; AI seats pick
at once. A turn that runs out takes the strategy the player highlights in the draft screen (`g.bandFocus {bandId?}`,
`Match.timeoutBand`) while it is allowed and no teammate holds it, else `bandDraft.timeoutBandId` 华法琳, else the first
free strategy by sortId (`defaultBand`; a departing seat gets `defaultBand` too). One skip per player (`g.bandSkip`: the
player moves to the end of the order; refused when nobody is left to pass to); a strategy a teammate already took is
refused (队友已选); band must list the mode type in `modeTypeList`. A single human (co-op with AI teammates only):
untimed. Solo: free pick, no timer, no skip. Starting LP = `bands[id].totalHp`.

### 1.2 机变 (SP draft)
Family = weighted pick from `choices.schedule[modeId].rounds[r].families`; cards: co-op 6 shared (each player takes 1,
random order, 30 s first / 16 s others, timeout ⇒ a random remaining card), solo 3; solo and single-human drafts are
untimed. The UI picks a card with two taps (select → 确认选择, DESIGN §18.2). A 驰援 tactic card
(`single_special_choice_gain_bond_chess`) is only offered while its bond still has chess in this match's pool
(`Match.bondInPool`; a bond whose every member is banned would grant nothing); more generally a 驰援 or 盟誓
(`global_special_choice_bond_addlayer`) card is offered only while one of its bonds is live (`Match.bondLive`: not in
the mode's static `inactiveBondIds` — 标准 has no 拉特兰 / 阿戈尔 / 卡西米尔 / 奥术 … — and with chess in the pool), so
玛恩纳的盟誓 / 莫斯提马的盟誓 / 卡西米尔驰援 never show up in 标准. Card generation and the
family defaults are documented in `choices.js` (bounty / supply / shop / tactic). 机密商店 cards are **free** (official
text "无需消耗资金") and follow the 4 official 机密商店 (choices.json `shopDraft`, build-data `SHOP_DRAFT`; the user:
"机密商店按官方改成可以重复吧"): six slots drawn with replacement — VI, VI, V, 盟约之币 and twice V / IV / III / 盟约之币,
an item within its tier weighted by the official cards it showed on — so the same item can be offered twice (official:
盟约之币 ×2, 变形同构体 ×2; the slot split and the weights [ASSUMED]) — at R11 (绝境 / 终极), the round of the
screenshots; the earlier 机密商店 of 标准 / 险境 (no screenshot) keep the previous draw, any tier I–VI per card with
replacement [ASSUMED]; two identical cards are two cards (picks go by index). 战术决策 follows the 4 official 战术决策
(choices.json `tacticDraft`, build-data `TACTIC_DRAFT`, `choices.js tacticDraftCards`; the user: "战术决策也按官方改成可以
重复吧"): each card drawn on its own, with replacement, so the same card can be offered twice (official match 7 R11:
补给 ×2) — at R11 (绝境 / 终极) only the ally cards (the 24 official cards hold no 排斥 / 责罚 / 裁决 and no terrain card),
each weighted 1 + the official cards it showed on (列装 / 财富 / 补给 / 整备 / 升华 made half of them) [ASSUMED: the
weights]; the earlier 战术决策 of 标准 / 险境 (no screenshot) keep every card, uniform, terrain cards only for the match
stage, with replacement too [ASSUMED]. At R11 the cards are drawn independently rather than in slots like the 机密商店
[ASSUMED, open: all 4 drafts hold a 驰援, a 盟誓 and two of 列装 / 财富 / 补给 / 整备 / 升华 — about 3 % under
independent draws, but a pattern spotted after the fact]. Identical tactic cards are separate cards as well: each pick
applies its own card once, and two picks of one team card (two players taking the twins) both reach every teammate and
add up — settled for the prep cards (补给 "可叠加"; 列装 / 财富 / 盟誓 grant their own items, coin and layers each time),
[ASSUMED] for the battle passives 自愈 / 火力 / 征召 / 无瑕 / 锐利: one buff per pick, so 锐利 ×2 ignores 60 % of the DEF
(open: whether the official keeps one instance of a 同名 env buff; twin passives come in about 4–5 % of R11 drafts).
The header reads the official "进行协同调整，做好迎战准备。". 悬赏决策 offers only choices.json cards with `draft: true` (`choices.js draftBounty`): never 战术特训 (PRTS
"※以下悬赏任务仅由法术教鞭生成") nor the 鸭爵 / 高普尼克 / 流泪小子 / 圆仔 cards (user playtest #6 item 4). **Each draft is
built like the official one of its round** (`choices.js bountyDraftCards`, choices.json `bountyDrafts` / schedule
`bountyDraft`; player feedback after 0.1.0, report #2 — late bounty enemies in the early drafts — settled by 66
screenshots of 22 official co-op 绝境 / 终极 matches of this season, readings in
`test/fixtures/official-bounty-drafts.json`): the event is a fixed card list and the draft shows 6 different cards of
it, each drawn with weight 1 + the official drafts of its group it showed in [ASSUMED]. **R3** one of the 10 official
sets of six "接下来两场作战" cards (all six), 3 × I + 2 × II + 1 × III in 22 of 22 — 9 seen, hand-made (one holds two
series-20 cards), the 10th built by a rule whose III is 法术大师A1 or 鼎沸 (the two-battle cards no draft showed)
[ASSUMED]; **R9** boss bounties + 源石虫·特训: one of 6 groups (one per bossInitial event; 庞贝 and 鼠王 never
together) of 9, 9, 9, 9, 8 and 6 cards — 9 where three named bosses came, the single-draft groups completed only with
the base cards they lack [ASSUMED; match 4's base-only group may instead be a draft of the 泥岩 group]; the 鼠王 group (杰斯顿 / “自在” / 陷落雪祀) came in 14 of 22 matches, every match on the dark grey board
among them, so a group is picked by the matches it came in [ASSUMED: something of the match — map, leader or
difficulty — decides, open]; **R11** (绝境 / 终极 co-op: 悬赏决策 14, 机密商店 4, 战术决策 4, never 道具补给, weights =
those counts; solo the same [ASSUMED]) a list of 7 "下场战斗" cards — one 特异III giant, one card per faction series —
of which the draft leaves out one (matches 1 / 6 / 21 / 22 leave out four different cards of one list); one of the 7
lists seen, uniform, so no list is invented [ASSUMED] (the data does not say which of the 15 events bounty_hunter_*
R11 fires: by its blocks it would be the 8 events 8..15, beside the 绝境 / 终极-only hardbuff_select; 7, 8 or 9 events
fit 14 drafts showing 7 lists about equally, 15 do not — with 8, an unseen list would come in about 1 R11 bounty draft
in 8, open), the 4 lists seen with 6 cards completed by that shape — so the R11 cards no draft showed (12_8 / 16_2 /
16_6) come in about 1 draft in 15 [ASSUMED]. 险境 R6 drafts like R3
[ASSUMED]. A card's enemy is fixed by its effect (`enemy_id`): the title only names category and tier (悬赏·损伤I =
底海滑动者 or 临时收音师). The players pick in turn from one shared draft (a taken card stays greyed with the taker's
avatar, as in the official matches 17 and 21).
No official draft showed a multi-round card, a pre-series card (enemyeffect_3_*) or the boss bounties 凋零骑士 / “遗弃者”
/ 锏 / 扎罗 / 迷路的巨像: `draftExcluded: 'unseen'` [ASSUMED], flipped by adding them to build-data
`BOUNTY_INITIAL_SETS` / `BOUNTY_BOSS_GROUPS` / `BOUNTY_HUNTER_GROUPS` once a screenshot shows one. The card positions are shuffled; solo
shows 3 of the 6 [ASSUMED]. The mode's inactive enemy list does not thin the draft (PRTS
11/18 note "不影响悬赏决策出场"). Every bounty card carries the effect's official rich text `descRaw` (the battles in blue
"下场作战" / "两场作战"; the overlay and the effects column render it; the effects column also says "还剩 N 场作战").
**Multi-round cards last two battles** (`choices.js MULTI_ROUND_BOUNTY_BATTLES = 2`, `bountyBattles` / `bountyText`): the
user does not remember any multi-round bounty (playtest #6 answer, "我不记得有过多轮悬赏"), so until that is confirmed
otherwise every "之后 / 后续的每场作战" card — e.g. 教鞭's 法术大师A2·多轮战术特训 — lasts two battles exactly like the
"接下来两场作战" cards, and its card and effects text read "接下来两场作战" in the same blue (还剩 N 场作战).
`MULTI_ROUND_BOUNTY_BATTLES = null` restores the official red "每场" (every later battle; effects column
"之后的每场作战"). The 战术特训 cards are what the 教鞭 Art offers (§2.5).
A `choice:<effectId>` registry handler overrides the default application (§2.4).

### 1.3 Disconnects, AI takeover
* Disconnected human: the seat keeps playing its last lineup; drafts auto-resolve at their deadlines, prep auto-readies at
  the deadline (an open 教鞭 choice is picked at random first, §2.5; then the temp pieces due at that prep are sold/destroyed). Nothing is bought for them. A battle the human was authority of goes to the server
  (normal / 联防: re-simulated from t = 0) or, on a boss field, to the partner's replica (DESIGN §14). The session stays
  resumable for 10 min (net.js `reconnectWindowMs`); a **solo** run's for the official `constants.singleReconnectTime`
  (86 400 s = 24 h, lobby.js `soloResumeWindowMs`) — nothing in a solo run is timed, so it simply waits. `onReconnect`
  resends `m.public`, `m.private` and the `b.start` of the field the player is on / watching.
* `g.autoplay { on }` ("AI 托管"): the bot plays the seat (drafts, buying, placement, an open 教鞭 choice, ready) until turned off.
* `onLeave` (quit / reconnect window expired): 中途退出 counts as elimination (research 00-INDEX §3, 01 §9, 06 §7 /
  §10.3): every copy the seat holds returns to the shared pool at once; the seat leaves the round loop and the Final
  Assault pairing (re-planned when it quits before the boss fight) and the boss pool (bloodPoint per player alive when
  the fight starts — a departed seat no longer counts, DESIGN §25.13.4); its
  running normal battle is force-ended; a pending band pick
  becomes the default band, a 机变 turn passes on and an open 教鞭 choice goes with the seat (`eliminate`). Status `left`, LP 0, rounds passed = the rounds it had survived.
  When no human is left at all the match ends immediately (`reason: 'abandoned'`); when only eliminated spectators are
  left it ends as `'eliminated'`.

### 1.3a Solo pause
`g.pause { on }` (`Match.setPause`, DESIGN §14 Solo pause): solo matches only (co-op → `WRONG_PHASE`), `on: true` only
while a battle runs (COMBAT / 最终攻势 / 隐秘核心 with a live field, not while the Final Assault is ending); `on: false`
always. While paused (`m.public.paused`) the field clocks, the authority deadlines / release timers, the boss clock
(overtime drain, silence watchdog) and the server pacers stand still; `_resume()` shifts `deadline`, `overtimeAt`, the
fields' `startAt` / `lastProgressAt` and the boss start by the paused time and re-arms the timers. A disconnect or
`onLeave` resumes; the battle phase ending clears it (`pausedMs` totals the paused time).

### 1.4 Watching fields
Client-side combat (the default, DESIGN §14 Spectating; `Match._watchClient`): `g.watch` answers with the field's
`b.start` (a display replica fast-forwarded to the field clock); an alive player may not watch another normal field
while its own normal battle runs (`WRONG_PHASE 'own battle running'`) nor the other pair's boss field (`BAD_TARGET 'other
group hidden'`); eliminated players watch anything. Whatever is watched, the viewer's bond strip shows the bonds of the
player on screen from that player's `m.public players[].bonds` (§5) plus the replica's live layers (DESIGN §20.15) — no
extra message. On a shared field (联防 / a pair's boss field) the client remembers the teammate picked with 前往查看
(the `g.watch` request still names the field) and frames that player's half; a viewer who does not fight on the field
never gets its own strip there. A detail card's bond chips — and the popup a chip opens — follow the unit's owner
(the popup carries the player it was opened for); a teammate's popup lists as members their operators in the battle on
screen (the runner's `ownerOps`, its field meta predating their deploy). A client-side 返回战场 without an own field to return to (a 联防 leaker, an eliminated
player) sends no `g.watch` (it would be refused with `BAD_TARGET 'no such field'`). A reload / reconnect while watching a
teammate's battle after the own one gets the watched field again (`_resendBattle`, `b.start watch: true`); the fresh
screen adopts it as the watched field once per battle (`battle/observe.js resumedWatch`: a living player's teammate
normal battle in COMBAT, first seen while watching nothing), so the observing pill, 返回战场 and the own row work again.
Spectator seats (a remake feature, community report #26; server/lobby.js): `opts.spectators` / `addSpectator(id)` register
a spectator — no PlayerState, a stand-in with `alive: false` — that every watch path treats like an eliminated human
(`_viewers()`: the first field of each battle, the 联防 spec, the first boss field, `g.watch` anything; `addSpectator`
also resends the state on a join mid-match and each resume); it never gets `m.private` / `m.toast` / `m.unitStats`, is
never a field's player or authority, its `b.start` spec omits the players' `contentInfo.funds` (`_spectatorSpec`: read by
no battle effect), it gets the settlement's `m.result`, and `handle()` answers only its `g.watch` (else `SPECTATOR`).
The rest of this section is the legacy server-run mode
(`SP_COMBAT=server`):
`g.watch { fieldId }`: any live field during COMBAT / 联防; while no battle field is up (PREP, drafts, SETTLE)
`'n:<pid>'` keeps the viewer scouting that board and pushes `prepFieldMeta` again when it changes (GitHub #87) — during a battle phase an `'n:<pid>'` id must name a live field
(`BAD_TARGET 'no such field'` otherwise, and the viewer keeps its stream). In the
最终攻势 / 隐秘核心 a player fighting in a boss field may only watch its own field ("两名参与者会处于同一个战场，但无法查看
另一组队友的战场情况" → `BAD_TARGET 'other group hidden'`); eliminated / departed players spectate any field.

### 1.5 AI player (bot.js)
**Strategy** (`botPickBand`): weighted by starting LP among the offered bands (alone, 老鲤's withheld first-round funds
× 0.02); a band whose mechanic rides on a bond the mode switches off weighs 0 — `GameData.bandBondIds` (bands.json
`bondIds`, built by shared/bandBonds.js: the bond names in <…> of its text, the bond ids / bond pools of its blackboards)
∩ `modeInactiveBonds`: 标准's 潘格尼尼, 克莱门莎, 玛恩纳 — and with every offered band excluded it takes the default band;
one rng draw per pick (DESIGN §21.26). The strategy draft marks the same bands 本局禁用 for humans (still selectable).
Buys toward a full board first (the cap is 8 from R1; leftover funds are lost), completes the merges it can afford,
then levels on a curve (L2 ≈ R3, L3 ≈ R5, L4 ≈ R7, L5 ≈ R10, L6 ≈ R12 — the competent curve of docs/BALANCE.md; free
levels always), then spends the rest (a band that keeps its leftover funds — 坎诺特 利滚利 — holds its interest capital
of 5 back from refreshes, full-board buys that complete nothing, items and spare level-ups). It builds around a
**focus core bond** (owned members × 10 + members the shop can still bring at its level + banked layers + 6 for last
round's focus, − 6 when it is a teammate's main core bond on that teammate's bond strip — humans included: the pool is
shared) and a **second bond** (most owned members, next threshold within reach); its keepers are the deployed
operators, the focus / second members and chess of tier ≥ shop level − 1. With a full board a purchase must be merge
progress or a lineup upgrade **and** be worth more than the refreshes its price would pay for: a refresh is worth
Σ over the held pairs of P(the refresh shows the third copy) × the value of an elite (the shop's copy-weighted odds
over the remaining pool; an elite also brings the merge's free pick of the next tier, so any pair is worth completing)
— otherwise it refreshes. Up to 4 pairs wait on the bench (6 spare units, pairs first); a third copy it cannot afford
freezes the shop for the next round (freeze is free). Purchase scores: merge progress > bond thresholds > role needs
(2 blockers, anti-air when the wave flies, ≤ 2 healers) > tier, the 特质 that keep adding layers, and armour fit (the
share of a dealer's damage that gets through the round's DEF / RES — `mitigate` of the sim per hit, HP-weighted over
the wave; an attack on every enemy in range counts ×2 — 阵法术师 / 轰击术师, `rangeAoe` since 0.1.1 —, a splash ×1.3, a
chain ×1.4 [ASSUMED], `CROWD`). The deployed set maximizes unit value + activated bond tiers (exact counting via `computeBonds`; every
deployed focus member counts toward the next threshold). Items by what they do: equipment on the strongest deployed
damage dealers (survival items on blockers first, bond signature items on a member), 信标 on a bench single (never the
lineup when a bench single exists), 拟态物质 on a pair (never on 2 copies whose pool is out), 博士投影 (both qualities — neither takes an elite) on the strongest
normal operator, 突变细胞 on the least valuable normal operator below 6阶 (deployed or benched — never an elite, never one
of a merge pair, never one already carrying a cell; it comes back after every transformation, and a cell left in temp
gets a hand slot made for it, `makeHandRoom` — on a bot's own seat by destroying the cheapest other hand item if no
chess can be sold, never a human's item under AI 托管 — on such a seat any item left in temp with a full hand gets a
hand slot the same way, a bench operator sold for it; only a hand of nothing but items still drops it, as the temp
deadline would; the operator a transformation gains waits on the bench and the next prep's lineup step deploys it
like any owned unit — AI 托管 too; the buy loop's bench shed, which sells by piece value while the bench is crowded,
never sells a piece gained since the bot's last prep ended, `rememberOwned`), 身份牌 / 通讯机 / 寻呼模块 on a focus
member; 画卷 copies the most
valuable deployed operator; 教鞭 / “神秘顾客” are used after a perfect battle and otherwise kept in the hand — a bot drops
a kept one only when it needs the hand slot (“神秘顾客” then pays its fund), a human's seat under AI 托管 never; 教鞭's three
cards are scored like a 机变 bounty draft (§2.5). 机变: a
bounty card is scored by its expected payout minus its expected leaks × the value of an LP (2 + 20 / LP), the kill
chance from the exposure model below for that one enemy against the own board as it stands (its HP × the round's
multiplier, DEF / RES, speed, route kind) — an expected-value comparison: it prefers the card with the best payout
minus expected LP loss and takes one it is unlikely to beat only when nothing better is offered or the pay difference
is large (in co-op 绝境 most remaining bounty leaks come from drafts with no beatable card at all); tactic cards by what
they act on (a 盟誓 / 驰援 card on its bonds, 升华, …). Placement uses the round's enemy preview: every route is traced
over the own board (ground: the stage's device-aware ground paths; flyers: through their checkpoints) and weighted by
its enemies; an exposure model (time on each tile × DPS against the round's armour of the units covering it — each
unit's cover is the range it is deployed with under the player's loadout, `rangeRec` = `attackRangeGrid`, the grid the
server's `summonRange` and the card use —, blocker hold time, anti-air only on flying routes) is maximized greedily
(blockers, then damage dealers, then healers) over the server's deploy map (no 深水区, PlayerState.deployMap); a
blocker whose range is its own tile only (range 0-1, the one grid (0,0): 角峰, 古米, 泡泡, 折桠, 菲莱, 蛇屠箱, 塞雷娅, 余) takes a free
tile of the enemy road first — it blocks and hits nothing off it — and only when the road has none free any legal tile (0.2.2, PR #339 by
@IceCodeNew); a tactician's 援军 goes on a tile of the tactician's attack range (`PlayerState.summonRange`, the server's own rule; player
report #9 after 0.1.0), and a tile the server's `g.move` refuses is skipped for the next best one (the planner reads
`board.js legalTiles` on the deploy map; `g.move` is the judge). Boss
rounds: the player's boss-field template (`Match.bossWaves`) is mapped onto the own board (rows −7, the right player
of a pair mirrored, only the routes that end on its half) and the leader counts as 10 tough enemies with a 30 s dwell
on its first tiles, so the damage dealers reach stationary leaders.
**Rehearsal:** with `opts.botRehearsal = N` (default 3) the bot simulates the N best
distinct layout variants once each with the real `Battle` (a rehearsal seed, no meta dispatch, board restored exactly)
and keeps the one with the fewest leaks; a candidate whose counted leaks already exceed the best finished one's stops
early. A candidate is a whole battle — ≈ 20–300 ms of CPU (late rounds, 4 bots: 0.2–1 s per bot prep, about twice the
CPU of the real battles), so it never runs in one go on a real server: `Match.scheduleBotPrep` runs `botPrepBegin`
(economy + the default layout on the board), then steps the rehearsal in slices of ≤ `opts.botSliceMs` (default 8 ms of
wall clock, checked every 4 ticks; one scheduler callback each, so other rooms' battles and every request keep
flowing), then `botPrepEnd` (the rehearsed layout when it won, temp, Ready). The prep ending first drops the job (the
default layout stays). Virtual time runs it in one go (same decisions). Tests default rehearsal to 0
(`test/match/harness.js`); `tools/matchrun.mjs --rehearsal N` sets it.

## 2. Effect registry (content API)

```js
// server/sim/content/bands.js
export function registerMeta(registry) {
  registry.band('band_cannot', {            // 坎诺特 利滚利: +1 fund at round start when ≥ 5 were carried over
    onPrepEnd(ctx) { ctx.setCounter('cannot:left', ctx.funds()); },
    onRoundStart(ctx) {
      const b = ctx.data.bands.band_cannot.params;                    // numbers from data, never hard-coded
      if (ctx.counter('cannot:left') >= (b.capital ?? 5)) ctx.addFunds(b.interest ?? 1, 'band');
    },
  });
}
```

### 2.1 Keys
One handler object per key; a later `register` of the same key **replaces** the earlier one (content registers after
the engine built-ins, so content always wins). Sugar: `registry.band(id, h)`, `.bond`, `.garrison`, `.item`,
`.choice`, `.effect`, `.global`. A bare function registers `{ run: fn }`.

| key | runs for | source (`ctx.source`) |
|---|---|---|
| `global:<name>` | every player, every hook | `{ kind:'global' }` |
| `band:<bandId>` | the band's owner | `{ kind:'band', bandId, band }` |
| `bond:<bondId>` | every player (active or not — check `ctx.bondActive`) | `{ kind:'bond', bondId, bond: {count,active,tier,layers} }` |
| `garrison:<effectKey>` | owners of chess whose garrison has that `effectKey`, on its eventType hook only (§2.3) | `{ kind:'garrison', piece, garrisonId, garrison, bb, bbStr, where }` |
| `item:<itemKey>` | items **equipped** on owned chess (every hook); the item itself for onEquip / onArt / onDestroy | `{ kind:'item', piece, holder, item }` |
| `effect:<id>` | EffectRefs in `ps.effects` whose `key` is this key | `{ kind:'effect', ref }` |
| `choice:<effectId>` | the picker (and teammates for team cards) when the card is applied | `{ kind:'choice', card }` |

`itemKey` = item id without `_a`/`_b` (`chess_item_1_03_e`); Arts have no suffix (`chess_item_6_02_m`).
Normal and golden share the key: read `ctx.gd.item(ctx.source.piece.id).params` (or `ev.item`) for the numbers.

### 2.2 Hooks and events
Every handler method is `(ctx, ev)`; `ev` is shared by all handlers of one dispatch and may be mutated where noted.

| hook | when | `ev` |
|---|---|---|
| `onIncome` | ROUND_START, before the income is credited | `{ round, income, pending }` — write `ev.income` / `ev.pending` (e.g. 老鲤 withholds R1–R2 income until R3) |
| `onRoundStart` | ROUND_START, after income / shop roll | `{ round }` |
| `onPrepStart` | PREP opens (after 机变) | `{ round }` |
| `onPrepEnd` | prep end, before funds are cleared | `{ round }` |
| `onGain` | a chess / item was acquired (buy, reward, grant, merge result) | `{ piece, kind:'chess'|'item', source }` |
| `onSold` | a chess was sold (after refund of copies) | `{ piece, gain }` — **write `ev.gain`** to change the funds paid |
| `onRefresh` | manual refresh | `{ slots, free, price }` (slots mutable, or use `ctx.setShopSlot`) |
| `onPrice` | every price query of a shop slot (views + buy) — must be **pure** | `{ slot, kind, id, price }` — write `ev.price` / `ctx.setPrice` / `ctx.modifyPrice` |
| `onBuy` | after a shop purchase (`g.buy` only) | `{ piece, slot, price, kind }` (`piece` = owned result, elite after a merge). The "购买" counters — 休露丝 首名<谢拉格> 1 资金, 玛恩纳 每购买一名<卡西米尔>, 升华 / 整备 "接下来购买的…" — hook it, so a free pick (promotion reward, 寻呼模块 / 信标 / 凯瑟琳 offers: `g.reward`) or a grant (紧急调度券, 简易通讯机, 拟态物质, strategies) never counts as a purchase (player report F2 after 0.1.0; PRTS 帮助 describes the promotion reward as a 0-cost temporary shop — whether the official 雪域礼赠 counts that pick is unknown, [ASSUMED] no) |
| `onMerge` | chess or item merge | `{ kind, piece, baseId|itemId, consumed:[uid], area? }` — a chess merge's `area` is where its elite went: 'board' (a consumed copy's tile) \| 'hand' \| 'temp' |
| `onLevelUp` | shop level up | `{ level, price }` |
| `onSpend` | a payment's action is complete (buy / refresh / levelUp / reward / effect) | `{ amount, reason, total }` (`total` = funds spent this match) |
| `onBattleStart` | a battle input is built (normal / unite / boss / hidden); also for the stats preview (`g.unitStats`, DESIGN §18.5) | `{ input: PlayerBattleInput, kind, round, spawns?, routes?, side?, preview? }` — mutate/replace `ev.input`; `ev.spawns` (the field's spawn list, shared by a boss field's players) may be edited in place. Boss / hidden fields also carry the wave's `routes` and the player's `side` ('L' / 'R' on a pair field — its half is the routes ending left / right of the middle column — null on a one-player field), so a handler can edit only the player's own enemies (鸭爵's swap). With `ev.preview` true (no `ev.spawns`) a handler must NOT change match state or draw match rng: the preview only reads the input |
| `onBattleResult` | SETTLE (normal rounds) and after boss fields | `{ result, lpLoss, perfect, unite?|boss? }` |
| `onChoicePick` | a 机变 card was applied (the card's own `choice:` handler runs first, then every source observes) | `{ card, family, picker, forTeammate }` |
| `onEquip` | `g.equip` (item handler only) | `{ item, target, golden, consumed, keep, error }` — see §2.5 |
| `onArt` | `g.art` (item handler only) | `{ item, row, col, targets:[pieces], error, used }` |
| `onDestroy` | an item was destroyed (player / replaced) | `{ item, holder, reason }` |
| `onLayers` | bond layers were added (prep or battle gains) | `{ bondId, from, to, reason }` (milestones: 维多利亚 25, 远见 10, 奇迹 100 …); `to` ≤ 999 (`BOND_LAYER_CAP`) — a gain at the cap dispatches nothing, so the milestones stop with the count |

Dispatch order per player: `global` → `band` → `bond` (data order) → garrisons (board in reading order — top row first, `board.js boardOrder` —, then hand)
→ equipped items → EffectRefs (insertion order). `onPrice` runs the priced chess's own 特质 first (购买价格为N sets the
price that 远见's discount and the strategies' caps then act on). Every call is isolated with try/catch (the error is
logged once and counted in `match.dispatcher.errors`); nested dispatches are capped at depth 6.
The equipped-items step walks a snapshot (the owned chess and each holder's items as they stand when it begins: every
[holder, item] pair, taken before the first item runs) and runs an item only if, when its turn comes, it is still
equipped on that holder and the holder is still owned: handlers move and destroy pieces mid-walk (突变细胞 transforms its
holder, normal 博士投影 destroys itself), so an item a handler took off is skipped and the item after it still runs; a
piece gained or equipped meanwhile waits for the next dispatch, and an item moved meanwhile runs at most once.

### 2.3 Garrisons (特质)
The dispatcher calls `handler[hook] ?? handler.run` only on the hook of the garrison's `eventType` (a handler may widen
that per garrison with `garrisonHooks(garrison) → hook[]`, e.g. "<进入休整期时><休整期结束时>"):

| eventType | hook | whose garrisons |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_GAIN` 获得时 | `onGain` | the gained piece — run **×2 while 投资人 is active, ×3 at ≥ 100 投资人 layers** |
| `SERVER_PREP_START` 进入休整期时 | `onRoundStart` | owned chess: board, and hand unless `bbStr.conditionkey === 'character_target_inboard'` |
| `SERVER_PREP_FIN` 休整期结束时 | `onPrepEnd` | same |
| `SERVER_REFRESH_SHOP` 刷新时 | `onRefresh` | same, as they stood when the refresh happened (taken before its first handler: a chess gained during the dispatch — 贾维's gift, the elite it completes — waits for the next refresh; one that left is skipped) — manual refreshes only (`ev.trigger` marks a re-run); 拉普兰德's "本回合首次主动刷新" counts per copy (`incPieceCounter`) |
| `SERVER_CHESS_SOLD` 售出时 | `onSold` | the sold piece |
| `SERVER_PRICE` 购买价格 | `onPrice` (first) | the chess in the priced slot (`ctx.source.where === 'shop'`); SERVER_CHESS_PRICE `bb.price` is the discount off the tier price (至简 3 − 2 = 1, 红豆 2 − 1 = 1: both texts say 购买价格为1) |
| `IN_BATTLE` | — | battle side (server/sim/content/garrisons.js `install`) |

```js
// garrisons.js — "<获得时>获得等于当前调度中心等级的【炎】层数（无需激活盟约）"  (SERVER_ADD_BOND_METHOD, add_method shoplv)
registry.garrison('SERVER_ADD_BOND_METHOD', {
  run(ctx, ev) {
    const { bb, bbStr } = ctx.source;                                   // garrison blackboard
    let n = 0;
    if (bbStr.add_method === 'shoplv') n = ctx.shopLevel() * (bb.multi ?? 1);
    else if (bbStr.add_method === 'hand_count') n = ctx.hand().filter((p) => p && p.kind === 'chess').length * (bb.multi ?? 1);
    const requireActive = ctx.source.garrison.desc.includes('已激活');
    ctx.addLayers(bbStr.bond, n, { requireActive });
  },
});
```

### 2.4 The handler context (`ctx`)
Reads: `playerId seat name round phase modeId difficulty isSolo isCoop data (frozen raw data) gd (GameData) rng`
(`rng()`, `rng.int(n)`, `rng.pick(a)`, `rng.chance(p)`, `rng.shuffle(a)` — the match's meta stream, never
`Math.random`), `funds() lp() alive() bandId() shopLevel() bond(id) bonds() bondActive(id) bondCount(id) layers(id)
board() hand() temp() piece(uid) pieceAt(row, col) pieceBonds(uid) garrisonsOf(uid) chessRecord(id) stats() roundStats()
shopSlots() effect(id)` (`piece(uid)` adds `area`, `holderUid`, `idx`; "身前一格" of (r, c) is (r, c + 1)),
counters `counter(k) setCounter(k, v) incCounter(k, n)` (player scope, persistent; prefix keys with your module) and
`pieceCounter(uid, k) incPieceCounter(uid, k, n)` (per piece, current round only: 0 in a new round and for a new piece —
bought, granted, transformed, or an elite merged this round (GitHub #169, the owner's decision of 2026-10-06) —; a move
keeps it; `PlayerState.pieceRoundCount`; prefix keys with your module too) — 拉普兰德's "本回合首次主动刷新" is the
first manual refresh that copy witnesses (player feedback after 0.1.0: "获得该干员后该回合的首次刷新" also stacks; a copy
bought after selling one this round is a new copy and fires on its own first refresh [ASSUMED]).

Writes (all validated, never throw on bad input, never make funds / pools negative):

| helper | effect |
|---|---|
| `addFunds(n, reason?)` / `addPendingFunds(n)` / `spendFunds(n)` | funds now / at the next round start / pay (false when short) |
| `addLayers(bondId, n, { requireActive })` | layer gain (`requireActive` = "使已激活的…"); returns layers added — at most the room left under `BOND_LAYER_CAP` (999, shared/constants.js `layerGainRoom`; the battle gains merged at SETTLE too); fires onLayers unless it added 0 |
| `grantChess(id, { toTemp, golden, requirePool=true, fromPool=true })` | acquire a chess (takes pool copies; with `requirePool` a pool chess with no copy left fails → `null`); merges; fires onGain. `toTemp` puts it into temp, but a free hand slot pulls it in at the next recompute (temp holds overflow only, `PlayerState._fillHandFromTemp`) |
| `grantItem(id, { toTemp })` | acquire an item (merges with an identical normal item); `toTemp` as for grantChess |
| `rollChess({ maxTier, tier, bond, filter })` / `rollItem({ pool, tier, maxTier })` | copy-weighted chess id from the shared pool / item id (choices.json pools) |
| `grantFreeRefresh(n)` | free refreshes (stack) |
| `modifyPrice(delta)` / `setPrice(v)` | onPrice only: edit `ev.price` |
| `promote(uid)` / `transform(uid, chessId)` / `upgradeItem(uid)` | elite in place / 突变细胞's transformation: destroy the chess wherever it stands (a board tile is freed; its equipment returns to the hand first, overflow temp), then gain `chessId` like `grantChess` (hand, overflow temp, the no-room rule; a merge it completes as usual — the carrier's tile is no copy's) and return the gained piece (the elite after a merge) / item → golden |
| `destroyPiece(uid)` / `equipDirect(itemUid, chessUid)` | remove a piece (chess copies return, items go back) / attach without equip effects |
| `offerChess(ids, { tier, label })` | queue a pick-one offer (shown as `shop.rewardOffer`, free) — 寻呼模块 / 信标 style; `label` (default `effectsMeta.offerLabel(source)`: the strategy's effect name, the item's name or the 特质's operator) is the shop bar's header instead of 晋升奖励 (`rewardOffer.source` `'special'`; the promotion reward is `'merge'`) |
| `offerItems(ids, { tier, label })` | the same for items (slots of kind `'item'`, drawn as item cards) — 凯瑟琳 定向投放 style (player report #6 after 0.1.0) |
| `triggerGarrisons(uid, eventType, { asUid })` | run another owned chess's 特质 of that eventType now (铃兰 "触发…的获得时效果"); 投资人 still multiplies SERVER_GAIN; SERVER_PRICE cannot be triggered; depth-capped |
| `setShopSlot(i, { kind, id, price?, frozen? } \| null)` | rewrite a shop slot (special refreshes) |
| `addDeployCap(n)` / `setDeployCapAtLeast(n)` | deploy cap (+effects; 人事部文档 = 9) |
| `setBondCountBonus(bondId, n)` | extra member count for a bond |
| `setDeviceActive(alias, on)` / `setTileOverride(r, c, 'melee'\|'ranged'\|'none')` | terrain changes of this player's board (legality + battle input `deviceOverrides`) |
| `addEffect(ref)` / `removeEffect(id)` / `setEffectCounter(id, v)` | EffectRefs `{ id, key?, name, desc, iconKind, iconId, counter?, battle=true, params?, data?, hidden? }` — shown in `m.private.effects`, passed to battles as `playerEffects` when `battle` |
| `addBounty(card)` | a bounty (choices.json cards.bounty shape) on the next battles |
| `offerBountyChoice(cards, sourceItemId)` | 教鞭 only: open a PERSONAL choice of up to three of `cards` (cards.bounty entries) for this player — shuffled once with the meta rng, kept in `m.private.personalChoice` until the owner confirms one (`g.choice { idx, choiceId }`) or the prep's deadline / an AI seat picks (§2.5); returns the intent result (`{ ok }`, or `{ error, detail }` for a phase that is not PREP, a Ready player, a choice already open or no card — before any rng draw or id, so the Art stays in the hand) |
| `toast(text, kind)` / `ticker(text)` / `giftTicker(fromName, chessId)` | messages |
| `teammates()` / `player(playerId)` | ctx objects of other alive players (team effects) |

### 2.5 Items: consume-on-equip and Arts
Items whose data `kind` starts with `consume_on_equip` resolve through their `item:` handler's `onEquip` and are
destroyed (they never take a slot); set `ev.keep = true` to keep the item equipped instead (博士投影 normal), or
`ev.error = 'BAD_TARGET'` (+ `ev.detail`) to refuse. On a full carrier the item `replaceUid` names (else the oldest) comes
off before `onEquip` runs and is destroyed (`onDestroy` reason `replace`) once the effect went through — the carrier keeps
a free slot, which a kept item takes —, and goes back where it was when the effect refuses (GitHub #263). Without a
registered handler the equip is refused (`BAD_TARGET 'effect not available'`). Arts (`MAGIC`): `g.art` needs a handler; at most `maxArtsPerRound` (2) per round;
`ev.targets` are the pieces under the Art's `rangeGrid` at (row, col); set `ev.error` to refuse, `ev.used = false` to keep it.
Other equipment: 2 slots; a third replaces the equipped item the player picks in the replace dialog — `g.equip
{ itemUid, targetUid, replaceUid }` (research 09 §1.2 `UseEquipUp.unloadInstId`; absent ⇒ the oldest; a `replaceUid` not
equipped on the target ⇒ `BAD_TARGET`, nothing changes) — and the replaced item is destroyed. Equipped items are
otherwise locked (research 04 §2 / addendum: they leave the operator only on promotion, merge or sale): `g.destroy`
refuses them (`BAD_TARGET 'equipped items are locked'`). A second copy of an equipped normal item merges into the golden
item in the hand. Every path that hands an item to the player (buy, reward, 机变, grants, equip, the equipment a sale,
a promotion or `ctx.destroyPiece` returns) ends with the auto-merge (`acquireItem` / `checkItemMerges`: "已拥有2件同一初始
装备时…自动合并"), so a player never holds two identical mergeable normal items (`test/match/feedback1b-items.test.js`), except an item gained while 休整期结束 is dispatching (`onPrepEnd`, including a grant nested under it): it is stowed (hand, else temp) and merges at the next prep's start, and nothing already equipped is taken off for the fight. Hand and temp both full still destroys it with 「整备区已满，获得的装备已销毁」. [ASSUMED] every such grant, not only 维多利亚's hammer (owner's decision 2026-10-04). A buy, an onPrepStart grant and a grant at any other time still merge at once (`test/match/feedback3-prep-end-item.test.js`).

Built-ins (builtinMeta.js, overridable): 盟约之币 / 骑士储蓄罐 (random funds), 随身身份牌 (layers of the target's bonds),
紧急调度券 (take shop chess), 精打细算玩偶 (+funds each round), 简易通讯机 (same-bond chess), 拟态物质 (with 2 copies
owned the 3rd — nothing when the pool has none left, GitHub #207 —, else a same-bond chess), 见钱眼开玩偶
(+funds next round), 人事部文档 (cap 9), 博士投影 (elite now / at the next round start), 寻呼模块 / 信标 (pick-one
offers; 信标 gifts the original chess — an elite stays an elite — to the teammate with the most members of its bonds next
round, also when the sender was eliminated meanwhile; a failed grant waits for the next round start), 商业包装方案 (every
N sells → same-bond chess), 突变细胞 (after battle the carrier — deployed or on the bench — is destroyed, its tile freed;
its equipment, the cell included, returns to the hand first; then a random NORMAL chess one tier higher, max 6, is
gained like any gained operator: into the 整备区, overflow temp, never onto the carrier's tile — official footage,
bilibili BV1vzyVBuEN9 ≈ 8:24 / BV1Qkw1zMEoR ≈ 7:25, pointed out in PR #2 — and a merge it completes as usual. The cell
is not consumed: PRTS 下半 记录 备注 "生效时，原干员销毁，获得一名高一阶的随机初始干员（最高六阶）", PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "佩戴的
装备无法手动卸除，在失去该干员（干员出售、销毁、合并等）…时自动卸除", players re-inject it every round; player feedback after
0.1.0), 画卷 (copy the operator in range with its
items — the copied items arrive unequipped in the hand, PRTS 画卷 备注 "获得的装备为未装备状态"), 教鞭 (a personal choice of three 战术特训 cards), “神秘顾客” (a random bounty is added).

**教鞭 offers a personal choice of three 战术特训 cards (0.2.2); “神秘顾客” stays a random bounty.** The official Arts open a
personal 悬赏 choice ("选择一项（特殊）悬赏任务进行挑战", `choice_event hunter_band_1`, choiceType `PERSONAL_CHOOSE`). 教鞭
(PRTS 下半 记录 §法术 教鞭 "使用后销毁，于3个战术特训的悬赏任务中选择一项"; §机变阶段 "※以下悬赏任务仅由法术教鞭生成"; 杜宾
加练！ "<教鞭>：使用后为下场战斗添加额外敌人，若自身战斗完美作战可获得资金"; user playtest #6 item 4 review) offers three of
the 20 战术特训 cards (payout `perfect`: extra enemies, the card's coins when the own phase is perfect), each limited to
enemies the mode can field. Until 0.2.1 the server took one of the three at random — a deliberate simplification: a
personal choice looked like it needed a phase of its own, a protocol message outside SP_DRAFT, a timer and an AI
takeover for a rarely used Art. The owner decided on 2026-10-08 to follow the official choice (PR #353 by @Sukvii), and
it fits in the existing parts:

* **Offer.** Content (server/sim/content/items/meta.js) calls `ctx.offerBountyChoice(cards, itemId)` (`Match.offerBountyChoice`,
  match/spDraft.js): the eligible cards are shuffled once with the meta rng and up to three different ones are kept in
  `ps.personalChoice { id, round, sourceItemId, cards }`. The Art is used up (and counts for the two per round) when the
  offer is made; nothing is applied yet. Refused — the Art stays in the hand, no rng draw, no id — outside the player's
  PREP, for a Ready player, while an offer is already open and when no card is left to offer.
* **Private.** Only the owner sees it: `m.private.personalChoice` (re-sent on a reconnect or a refresh, so the same cards
  and id come back); never `m.public`, a scout's view or a spectator. Players have offers of their own, at the same time.
* **Confirm.** `g.choice { idx, choiceId }` (`Match.pickPersonalChoice`) validates the owner, the id, the round and the
  index, then adds the card with `addBounty` and closes the offer; a request without a `choiceId` is the public 机变 draft
  as ever, and a stale, foreign or repeated id never falls through to it (`BAD_TARGET`). The client shows the overlay of
  the 机变 draft (`ChoiceOverlay`, `personal`: the same two taps, no order, no turns) over a locked prep.
* **No phase, no timer.** The offer lives inside PREP. Ready is refused while it is open (`setReady`: `BAD_TARGET`;
  `m.private.canReady` false), and the prep's own deadline resolves it: in a timed co-op prep `prepDeadline` takes one of
  the cards at random (the meta rng, like a 机变 turn that runs out) before the temp pieces and Ready; a solo or
  single-human prep is untimed and has no timer for it, and a disconnected player waits for the deadline like for any
  other prep action. A seat the engine plays — an AI teammate or a human under AI 托管 — picks like the bots do; a seat that
  left is eliminated (`onLeave` → `eliminate`), which drops its open offer: nobody picks for it.
* **The bots.** `bot.js` scores the three cards like a 机变 bounty draft (`botPickCard` → `bountyScore`: the expected
  payout minus the expected leaks × the value of an LP, against the own board; the bots' seeded rng only breaks ties), so
  the choice is deterministic for a seed: at the start of the bot's prep (an offer left by a human who turned 托管 on),
  right after it cast the Art, and before Ready. When a step of the bot's prep fails, the scheduler's fallback readies the
  seat with the random pick instead — no seat is ever left un-ready by an offer.
* The chosen bounty is a bounty like any other: next battles (a multi-round card lasts two, §1.2), 联防 payouts, the Final
  Assault / Hidden Core spawns — and in the boss rounds its perfect-battle coins (§3 Waves).

“神秘顾客” (granted by nothing in act2, no PRTS list of its cards) remains random: three cards are drawn from the band-bounty
family `enemyeffect_b_*` [ASSUMED], limited to enemies the mode can field, and one is added with `ctx.addBounty` (the
built-in fallback: a random tier ≤ II bounty of `cards.bounty`). Its destroy clause (+1 fund, the Art passes to the next
alive player) is content too (`onDestroy`).
EffectRefs: `effect:builtin_round_coin`, `effect:builtin_gift`, `effect:builtin_next_buy_golden_item` (整备),
`effect:builtin_next_buy_elite` (升华). An eliminated player gets no dispatch, except an EffectRef whose handler sets
`afterElimination: true` (its `onRoundStart` still runs: `EffectDispatcher.dispatchEliminated`, called by
`Match.startRound`) — only `effect:builtin_gift` does, so a 信标 gift reaches the teammate (GitHub #86).

### 2.6 机变 card application
`choice:<effectId>` handler (content) → else the family default (choices.js): bounty → `ctx.addBounty`; supply/shop →
item to the hand; tactic by buff key (`global_special_choice_gain_equip`, `_bond_addlayer`, `_gain_coin`, `_refresh_free`,
`single_special_choice_gloden_equip_chess`, `_gloden_char_chess`, `_gain_bond_chess`, `auto_chess_change_map`); every
other buff becomes a battle EffectRef (`key: 'choice:<effectId>'`, `params` = effect params) for the sim content.
Team cards (`team: true`) apply to every alive teammate as well.

```js
// choices.js — override the 自愈 card: keep it as a battle effect but show a counter
registry.choice('allybuff_select_11', {
  onChoicePick(ctx, ev) {
    // the EffectRef below carries this same key, so this handler also runs (source kind 'effect') on every LATER
    // onChoicePick dispatch — apply the card only when it is the card being applied
    if (ctx.source.kind !== 'choice') return;
    ctx.addEffect({ id: `heal:${ctx.round}`, key: 'choice:allybuff_select_11', name: ev.card.name, desc: ev.card.desc,
                    iconKind: 'team', params: ctx.data.effects.allybuff_select_11.params });
  },
});
```
Any `choice:` handler whose EffectRef reuses its own key must guard like this (or give the EffectRef an `effect:` key).

## 3. Rules implemented (summary; details in each module header)

* **Economy**: income `config.economy.income[r]` (= min(3+r, 12)); bounty coins / pending funds credited at the next
  round start; leftover funds lost at prep end except `leftoverFundsKeptByBands`. Chess price by tier (2/3/3/3/4/4),
  items by `price`, refresh 1 (free refreshes first), sell +1 (elite too; items cannot be sold, only destroyed).
* **Shop**: `shopSlots[level]` chess slots + item slot(s), copy-weighted rolls over remaining pool copies of unbanned,
  visible chess with tier ≤ level; item slot: tier by the same shares, uniform item within the tier. Level-up price =
  base per mode, −1 each round start (floor 0), reset to the next base after upgrading; an upgrade opens the new level's
  extra slots at once, empty (the cards shown stay; the empty slots fill on the next roll); `MAX_LEVEL` at 6. One freeze
  toggle freezes every unsold slot until the next round start; a manual refresh rerolls everything (new slots stay
  frozen). Unfrozen slots are cleared at combat start. Slot positions are stable (frozen slots keep their index).
* **Pool**: copies 12/14/18/16/8/5 (缪尔赛思 4); a normal piece holds 1 copy, an elite 3; displays never reserve copies;
  selling, temp resolution and elimination return exactly what a piece holds (`left + held = cap` always).
* **自选编队 (0.2.0, `player/diy.js`; research 0.2.0 §2, the owner's decisions of 2026-10-05)**: a human's `seat.diy`
  picks (room.diy, checked again against the match's data and kits) are fixed for the match; bots field none [ASSUMED].
  The player's `ps.gd` is then a view of the match's GameData whose `chess(id)` of a slotted slot (normal and elite) is
  the composed 自选 record (shared/diy.js `diyRecord`): every rule that reads a record through `ps.gd` — bonds
  (bondsMeta: BOARD / BOARD_AND_DECK distinct pieces, 煌's 炎 + 维多利亚, 绝技 elites), 特质 / meta effects (`makeCtx`
  hands handlers the player's view), placement and summon ranges, the AI 托管 evaluation (bot.js), names in toasts and
  tickers — sees the operator; a player without picks keeps the match's GameData itself. Each slotted piece has its own
  stock (`ps.diyStock`: `poolCopies` of the slot's tier, 8 / 5 [ASSUMED]; none — `diyBanned` — when every bond of it is
  off this match; `initDiyStock` once the bans are drawn); `poolOf(baseId)` routes its copy accounting (buy, reward
  picks, merges, promotions, sells, temp, elimination; `invariants.js` checks `left + held = cap` per player). The
  shop's chess slots and the reward offers' temporary refreshes roll it with the shared pool (`pool.roll({ extra })`,
  copy-weighted like any chess of its tier) once the 调度中心 reaches the slot's `shopLevel` (5 / 6) [ASSUMED for the
  reward offers]; an effect, reward pool or 机变 card that grants the player a random operator draws its stock too
  (effectsMeta `rollChess` / `rollPool`, the 驰援 fallback in choices.js: `ps.diyStockEntries()` — the roll's own tier
  rules, no 调度中心 gate, bonds through the player's view; 「自选干员放入后模拟中的补给池随机范围也将被相应扩大」, 0.2.0), and
  信标 never sends one to a teammate [ASSUMED]. `battleInput` carries `diy` (the pick); `m.private.diy` / `diyBanned`; `prepFieldMeta` and
  `m.result` lineups carry the pick (`diy`) so other players' cards compose the operator.
* **Hand**: 10 slots filled right→left, 5 temp slots for passive overflow (merge results, grants, returned equipment);
  a full hand refuses every buy and reward pick — also one whose copy would complete a merge at once (PRTS
  卫戍协议/帮助 §手牌区 "例如招募/购入等通常情况下会增加手牌的操作"; GitHub #82) — and withdrawals unless the withdrawn
  summoner's own summon stack frees a slot (a deployed summon withdrawn with no stack of its own left to join is a new
  card: `HAND_FULL`, never temp). A free hand slot pulls the temp pieces in at once ("常规手牌区出现空位时自动移入"):
  `PlayerState._fillHandFromTemp` at every recompute, the temp row right → left (the order it fills, [ASSUMED]) into the
  hand's free slots right → left — after a sale, a deployment, a merge that consumed hand copies, an item equipped /
  destroyed / used, a summon stack removed with its owner; so temp holds pieces only while the hand is full
  (`invariants.js`). Temp blocks Ready. A temp piece is resolved (chess sold back to the pool, items destroyed, a summon stack
  removed — it comes back at the next round start, see Summons) at the deadline of the first prep in which its player could act on it (`PlayerState.tempDue` vs
  `prepsEnded`, recorded by `_putTemp`, user playtest #3): arrived during a prep before Ready → that prep's end; after
  Ready, during onPrepEnd, or outside PREP (COMBAT, 联防, SETTLE, ROUND_START, 机变) → the end of the NEXT prep, so it
  is shown and usable first; `setReady(false)` makes what arrived while ready due at the current prep. The round
  start never wipes temp (DESIGN §6.2).
* **Merge**: 3 normal copies (风丸 2) anywhere (board/hand/temp) → 1 elite (the incoming copy, then temp, hand, board
  copies are consumed). Where it goes (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "发送1名【精锐】状态的该干员至手牌区（若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，
  则发送至作战区对应位置）", the user's playtest #6 follow-up): when a consumed copy stood on the board, onto that copy's
  tile with its facing — of several, the one that deploys first (col asc, then row desc; `board.js mergeTile`,
  [ASSUMED]); a 突变细胞 carrier is destroyed before its gain, so its freed tile is no copy's (`transformChess`, DESIGN
  §21.1); a tile the elite may not use (a stale terrain change) is skipped. It replaces a deployed copy, so the deploy count never
  grows (no BOARD_FULL), and as a deployment its manually deployable summons join the hand (`grantTokensFor`, the
  player's loadout). Otherwise the elite goes to the hand, overflowing into temp. Equipment returns to the hand (overflow
  temp; with both full it stays on the elite, up to its 2 equip slots — any further item is destroyed); summons of
  consumed copies are removed; a reward offer of 3
  **different** free chess of tier min(level+1, 6) (copy-weighted from the shared pool, already-drawn ones excluded; a
  short tier tops up from the tier below — user playtest #6 item 19; pick 1, expires at prep end; queued when several
  merges or special refreshes happen — `shop.rewardOffer.queued` counts the ones behind the shown offer). The same rule holds for every way a merge completes — buy, reward pick, effect / band / choice grants
  (`acquireChess`), transformations — and in every phase: a merge completed after the prep (SETTLE / Final Assault
  effects such as 突变细胞) keeps its offer for the next prep; its elite takes the deployed copy's tile at once, or goes to
  the hand / temp (kept through the next prep, see Hand). In a boss round's prep the tile is read on the player's half of
  the boss field (board coordinates unchanged). `onMerge` carries `area` ('board' | 'hand' | 'temp').
* **Board**: rows 9–12 × cols 2–10, legality from `stages[id].tiles` + devices (board.js); deploy cap 8 (+effects);
  summons don't use slots; board↔hand swaps always allowed. The legend's `buildable` is the effective deploy type: the
  深水区 (`tile_deepsea`, 战场#08's pool — level buildableType ALL) refuses deployment (PRTS 深水区 地形信息
  "拒绝部署（待补充）"; a 特制水上平台 device makes its tile deployable for any unit; player report #3 after 0.1.0). A
  terrain change (terrain 机变 cards such as 模拟战场演变·模式二 "阻隔工事变为射击台", content `setDeviceActive` /
  `setTileOverride`) is checked at the next `recompute()` (at the latest when the battle input is built): a piece left
  on a tile it may no longer occupy — a melee operator on a new 射击台 — is withdrawn to the hand (overflow temp:
  re-placed during the prep; its summons leave with it), a summon back onto its stack, with a toast
  (`PlayerState._evictIllegal`).
* **Summons** (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §战斗部署, user playtest #6): an operator placed on the board sends its manually deployable
  summons (tokens.json `placeable`: 赫默 S2 医疗探机, 巫恋 S2 诅咒娃娃, 凯瑟琳 爬行号·防护单元, 浊心斯卡蒂 海嗣, 伺夜 狼群,
  缪尔赛思 流形 — only those its equipped skill / module makes, `gamedata.placeableTokens(chessId, loadout)`) to the hand as
  one stack of deploy-limit copies (凯瑟琳 2 of her 3 devices); each copy is placed and turned like any piece (no deploy
  slot — the PRTS token pages give 部署占用数 0), only while its owner is on the board. Withdrawing / selling / merging the
  owner removes its summons; moving it to another tile (a move, a swap, or a summon dragged onto it — that summon stays
  where it was dropped) sends its placed summons back onto their stack ("移动干员时，其所属召唤物全部退场并重置至手牌区";
  `PlayerState._liftTokensOf`). A stack that overflowed into temp and was removed at a prep deadline comes back at the
  next round start (§手牌区 "干员所属召唤物会于下一回合返还": `PlayerState.startRound` tops every board owner's summons up
  to the deploy limit, `grantTokensFor`). A summon whose text reads "只能部署在召唤者攻击范围内" (tokens.json `ownerRange`:
  the tacticians' 援军, 伺夜 狼群 / 缪尔赛思 流形 — choosing the tactical point; player report #9 after 0.1.0) only goes on
  a tile of its owner's attack range: the owner's loadout grid (`attackRangeGrid`) rotated by its facing around its tile
  (`PlayerState._legal` / `summonRange`, `board.js ownerRangeKeys`; a summon dragged onto its own owner is checked from
  the owner's new tile, an operator dragged onto the summon from the summon's new tile); Mon3tr's 重构体 likewise (her
  talent), while 凯尔希·思衡托's 战术锚点 (`ownerRangeOutside` / `rangedTilesOnly`) goes only on a 高台 outside that range
  (`summonExcluded`, board.js class `high`). When the owner is re-oriented in
  place (or promoted) a summon its new range leaves out goes back onto its stack with a toast (`_liftOutOfRange` in
  `recompute`) — one still inside stays [ASSUMED]. A re-orientation that would leave such a summon with no stack and no
  free hand / temp slot is refused (HAND_FULL, like withdrawing a summon into a full hand); in the other cases (a
  promotion, an owner moved while hand and temp are full) the summon leaves the board and its stack comes back at the
  next round start (`grantTokensFor`), so no out-of-range placement reaches the battle. The client lights and accepts
  the same tiles (`ui/gameLogic.js summonRange`), the bot plans inside them. Battle side: SIM.md §1.1 token pieces.
* **Bonds**: bondsMeta.js (BOARD distinct, BOARD_AND_DECK, 绝技 elites, 调和 +1 — the state and the views mark it
  `harmony: 1`, DESIGN §21.26 —, 独行 downward, 助力 upper tiers, 变形同构体 grants). Σ activated layers for the hidden
  core = Σ layers of active bonds at the boss round's prep end.
  **变形同构体** (变形者集群 "与特定装备一同装备时装备者将视为特定盟约成员", 缪尔赛思's 特质 hands it out): its wearer
  with a bond item (`giveBondId`, the 14 pairings of the item's official talent) is a member of that bond — counted like
  any member (on the board only: the 14 bonds are BOARD; one member per operator, normal and elite copies alike), and
  so in the battle input / battle, the views, and on the client: the bond popup lists it among the members (tagged
  同构, `gameLogic.bondMembers` / `grantedBonds`, the same rule as `pieceBonds`) and its card shows the granted bond
  chip; a teammate's units carry their item ids for that (UnitInfo `items`, `Match.prepFieldMeta`, SIM.md §9), and a
  card without an own piece (a teammate's unit, the card a 同构 row opens) lists those items read-only under 装备. The
  item's card lists the 14 pairings of its 天赋栏 from the same `giveBondId` (`gameLogic.morphPairings`, 本局禁用 marked),
  the wearer's card highlights the pairing it wears, and a bond item's card names the bond it gives (DESIGN §21.26).
  Not covered [ASSUMED]: operator talents that test "【拉特兰】/【卡西米尔】/… 干员" in the kits read the record's bonds.
  **Layer cap** (research 11 §1; the client's `MAX_GARRISON_STACK` / `AddBondCount` = min(L + n, 999)): each bond's
  layers stop at `BOND_LAYER_CAP` = 999 (shared/constants.js; 0 / Infinity = off). Every writer clamps with
  `layerGainRoom` — `PlayerState.addLayers` (all prep-side gains: 特质, items, bands, 机变 cards, bonds; `ctx.addLayers`),
  the SETTLE of the in-battle gains and the battle's own live copy (`Battle.addLayers`, SIM.md §6); a gain at the cap
  adds 0 and dispatches no onLayers. The client-result check bounds a reported gain by the room left from the bond's
  starting layers and by 60 + 4·round plus what the player's IN_BATTLE layer 特质 can add to that bond (their per-battle
  caps; an uncapped trait leaves only the room — `fields.js layerAllowanceOf`, DESIGN §21.26) (`validateClientResult`,
  'layer bound'); `invariants.js` flags a bond above the cap. The
  bond strip, its popup, the effect text and the detail card show the server's capped count. The dev tools' direct
  writes (`tools/matchrun.mjs --layers N`, `tools/balance.mjs applyBoard`) stop at the cap too.
* **Waves**: waves.js header (stage/factions/boss per match, faction replacement per round with `k` copies, scaling by
  `enemyScale[r]` × the tuning layer §3.1, bounties, boss templates, 联防 routing). Bounties with battles left (every one
  that lasts more than one battle; an official multi-round card lasts two, §1.2) also spawn in the Final Assault /
  Hidden Core, on the owner's half of the boss field (a route ending at its goal); the boss battle then uses up one of
  the bounty's battles and its kill coins go to pending funds — with, for every perfect-payout card (战术特训), its coins
  as after a normal battle ("若各自行动阶段就达成完美作战，获得N资金"): once per player, when the team won (the first end the
  server registered: the leader's pool empty), the result is a real one (not the stand-in of a field that never
  reported) and the player's own field let no counted enemy through [ASSUMED: the text has no boss-battle exception, and
  the card's enemies do come in the boss battle] — and, for a field a client reported (the boss path never re-simulates
  it), the result agrees with what its authority reported while it fought: LP it asked the team to pay must have been
  split in `b.progress.leaksBy` (per player, the enemy leaks; the rest is the leader's own "扣除目标生命" effects), and a
  player's leaked list must show at least its reported leak LP (`Match._bossLeaksAgree`), so a result cannot hide a charged
  leak or hand it to the other seat; a server-run field is the truth itself. They are spent in the Hidden Core's prep like
  the kill coins.
* **Combat time limit**: data `combatTimeLimit` (the level's `maxPlayTime`) counts REAL seconds of the forced 2×
  battle; the Battle / 联防 limit is `gd.combatTimeLimit(r)` = 2 × that in game seconds (`config.combatTimeScale`,
  default 2). Read as game seconds the rounds' own spawn schedules would not fit (R2's last flyer spawns at 43 s of
  45 s, R3's at 62 s of 55 s); × 2 every limit ≈ last spawn + one flyer crossing. docs/BALANCE.md §2.1.
* **SETTLE**: LP −min(counted leaks, 10) (after 联防: survivors attributed to their source, same cap); IN_BATTLE layer
  gains applied, each bond up to `BOND_LAYER_CAP` (999, `layerGainRoom`, as `PlayerState.addLayers`); kill-bounty coins (paid by the Battle to the killer — a 联防 helper included; a death no operator caused pays the card's owner, in 联防 the helper whose half it fell on: `Battle._bountyPayee`) and perfect-bounty coins
  (own phase perfect) go to pending funds; bounty rounds decrement; LP ≤ 0 ⇒ eliminated (all copies back to the pool).
* **Final Assault / Hidden Core**: finalAssault.js header. Boards are passed in board coordinates; the sim maps board
  rows 9–12 onto boss rows 2–5 (`BOSS_ROW_OFFSET` −7, matching every stage's boss rows) and mirrors the right side.
  Pool (`finalAssault.js bossPoolHp` → `GameData.bossPoolShare` → `gamedata.js bossPoolShareOf`, DESIGN §20.10,
  §25.13.4): one pool shared by every boss field (official tip "最终攻势中，所有人将一起对敌方领袖造成伤害"; notice 5114's
  "敌方领袖的总生命值不变" is about the mirrored copies of a pair field sharing it) = `bloodPoint[difficulty]` × the players
  alive when the fight starts (bots and AI 托管 seats count, eliminated and departed seats do not; solo × 1) — the owner's
  decision of 2026-10-06, adopting PR #209 by @qingjingshenghuo (players' observation: bloodPoint is one player's share),
  which replaces the fixed pool of 「保持固定血量」 (config `bossHpScale.perPlayer: false` with `solo: 0.25` restores it;
  its optional × alive / 4, `aliveScaling`, stays off); leaders are never scaled by `enemyScale`, their parts and escorts
  keep their own HP. The merged team LP loses leaks (`lpr`), the overtime drain
  (`bossTurnHpReduceTime` 150 counts REAL seconds, like the boss level's 120 s maxPlayTime that runs out first — the
  battle goes on — so 1 LP per real second from 150 real s = 300 game s on the 2× field clock; `gd.bossOvertimeDue`)
  and leader "扣除目标生命" effects (the sim's `lpLoss` hook: boss_7 Doom, 斥退 …); after every change it is written back
  to the alive players as shares of the LP each brought in (`lpAtFinal`, largest remainder), so `lp` in m.public /
  m.private / m.result is what is left (Σ = team LP).
  Client-side combat (DESIGN §14): a boss field's reports are plausibility-bounded on the SERVER's field clock — the
  credited pool damage of one field ≤ the whole pool per `BOSS_MIN_CLEAR_GS` (5) game s (20 %/s; the balance model's
  fastest mean kills run ≈ 5 %/s per field), its LP cost ≤ 10 + 1 per game s; reports are cumulative, so what exceeds
  the budget is credited later (the boss clock re-applies the latest report), never lost. A boss field's `b.result` ends
  it only when the pool is empty or after the match's `b.end`; a 'cleared' result whose report covers what the pool
  holds waits for the budget instead (`f.heldResult`: no takeover — 999-layer kills take 2–4 game s, DESIGN §20.14);
  any other (a 'forced' result at t = 0, 'cleared' while the pool holds more than the report covers, a result failing
  validation) hands the field to the partner's replica or the server, and the sender is never its authority again
  (`f.demoted`). Every boss field run by the server (takeover, or nobody connected at the
  start) publishes its own damage as `b.pool.acked[fieldId]` (its CreditPool total), so the display replica of a
  reconnecting / watching human stays in sync.
  End and verdict (user playtest #6 item 5): the pool never holds less than 1 HP (`sim/constants.js BOSS_POOL_MIN_HP`:
  the hit — or the per-player credit of a report — that would leave less takes the rest; the browser's `LocalBossPool`
  reads anything below 1 as 0), so a pool shown at 0 is a dead leader on every field and the round ends at once. Before,
  crediting a report per player could leave float dust (3.6e-12) that no browser hit could remove and the leader fought
  on until the overtime drain. The first end condition the server registers decides (`Match._finalEnding`): pool 0 →
  victory, team LP 0 → defeat (PRTS 卫戍协议：盟约 下半 "…使目标生命值扣除至0，则无视倒计时直接失败"); after a forced end
  no report (an in-flight `b.progress`, the final `b.result` with its rounded per-player damage) credits the pool.
  **限伤** (research 11 §2; client `AutoChessStepModeManager._OnBossEnemyTakeDamage`): in both boss rounds a single hit
  on a leader with ceil(damage) ≥ `BOSS_HIT_LIMIT` = 300000 (shared/constants.js; 0 / Infinity = off) is cancelled in the
  sim (`sim/damage.js leaderHitCancelled`, SIM.md §4) — it deals 0 and nothing reaches the shared pool, the per-player
  boss damage or the BOSS_HIT tickers; minions, parts, normal rounds and 联防 are unaffected. 胄's drone link (2 % of the
  pool when a drone dies) is a share, no hit, and passes the limit (`Battle.loseHp noHitLimit`; with the per-player pool
  a hidden 胄 终极 drone is 432 000 / 576 000 at 3 / 4 players [ASSUMED], §25.13.4). The server's own runs, the browsers'
  runs and the server's verification share the rule, so digests agree.

### 3.1 Balance layer (data/tuning.json)
`data/config.json` is generated and stays research-faithful. There is **no custom balance** any more (DESIGN §14
corrections, research 08 §6): enemy numbers are the official ones (the PRTS `enemyScale` table, the leader table
`bloodPoint` — × the players alive by the owner's decision of 2026-10-06, §25.13.4). `data/tuning.json` (hand-maintained, loaded as `data.tuning`, layered on the config by gamedata.js only)
keeps just the result-title rules:

```jsonc
{ "titles": { "comment_3": { "stat": "lpLost", "rule": "min" } } }   // merged over config.titles
```
The former `enemyHpMul` / `enemyAtkMul` / `enemySpeedMul` / `bossHpMul` / `flyPlaceholders` knobs were removed; a
tuning file that still carries them is ignored (`gd.bossHpMul()` always returns 1). `tools/balance.mjs --tuning off`
drops the file (titles only, so the numbers are the same). Titles: `rule: 'min'` ranks the players still alive by the
smallest stat (坚若磐石 "目标生命值损失最少" = least `lpLost`). docs/BALANCE.md has the balance measurements.

---

## 4. 联防 (Unite)
Planned after the normal combats, at the end of the COMBAT_END pause from the players still in (`Match._afterCombat`, so a
player who quit during the last field or the pause is neither a helper nor a leaker whose enemies re-enter; unite.js):
helpers = `unite.js helperOrder` (research 08 §5, PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §联防阶段): ≤ `unite.maxHelpers` (2) perfect players
chosen by most units on the field (downed included) > an active bond > most standing units > seat; the pair ordered by
units > active bond > Σ active layers > standing > seat (LP plays no part), the first one on the right-hand field
(colOffset +8, where escaped_multi enters), the other colOffset 0; the escaped template of that size routes the leaked
enemies by slot class on the round's battlefield — the match stage opened to both halves (`GEO.UNITE_RECT`, cols 0–20),
its terrain, crates, water, devices, runes and band map characters included, as in 0.1.x (the owner's decision of
2026-10-07, 「官服保留地形」; 0.2.0 fought it on the escaped levels' own map, the placeholder road every wave template
carries — GitHub #41, withdrawn), each helper's pieces on their prep tiles; helpers' operators carry
`{ hpPct, sp }` from `unitsEnd` ("阵地以其当前状态": the HP ratio and the 技力 only — a skill running at the end enters
switched off; summon pieces `{ sp }`, "召唤物仅修改技力"); an operator knocked out at the end of the helper's own
combat carries `{ down: true }` (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助: "部署完成后…上一阶段为退场状态的干员强制退场"): deployed, then forced out
at once, it lies on its tile with the redeploy ring and redeploys like after any knock-out (docs/SIM.md §1.1; user
playtest #5 item 2 — it used to stay out and vanish); its timer is its full redeploy time (the official setup carries
only hp / tech per operator; confirmed by the user), with the redeploy-time effects that start with the battle (机变 征召); summons are
fielded as the board has them (their SP carried); `flags.layerGainsEnabled = false`; time limit = the round's combat limit.
Every enemy still alive at the end (leaked again, or never spawned before the limit) costs its **source** player 1 LP.
A client-run 联防 result may bill a survivor only to a leaker who sent that enemy in — a split / summon only to a leaker
who sent in its parent, ≤ the parents' data offspring count (磨砻 2, 烹泉 4 …; fields.js offspringPerParent).
**Live counter** (user playtest #6 item 7; PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "防卫失败的玩家可通过上方信息栏确认自身所属敌人的剩余数量"):
while the 联防 runs, each leaker's `m.public players[].uniteLeft` = its enemies still standing on the field (not spawned
yet, alive, or through again) + its leaks that could not re-enter — what settlement would charge before the cap —
and `pendingLp` = min(`lpCapPerRound`, uniteLeft) (`Match._uniteLeft`). Sources: the authority's `b.progress.left`
(`{ [leakerId]: n }`, server/sim/spec.js `uniteLeft` / `battleProgress`), the server-run field's timeline samples
(`fields.js timelineSample`: `[gt, killed, total, left]`) read on the field clock, or the streamed battle itself
(legacy mode; `_uniteTick` republishes about once a game second); exact from the field's result once it is done
(`uniteSurvivors`). Live values are clamped to what settlement can bill that leaker (`fields.js uniteBillBounds`: sent
in + the offspring bound). It falls as the helpers strike them down and rises when one splits or summons (the children
carry the leaker); every client that has the 联防 field on screen shows its local replica's counts while it runs — the
leaker's own capsule / row (`ui/hud.js uniteRemaining`) and the leakers' team rows (`ui/teamPanel.js rowLp`
`uniteLocal`, the battle runner's `state().uniteLeft`) — else this value. The settled loss stays min(10, survivors).

## 5. Views (DESIGN §8.2 / §8.3) and deviations

`m.public` (throttled ≤ 10/s, only sent when it changed) carries the DESIGN fields plus: `drawnDisabledBonds` (the 3+4
drawn set; `disabledBonds` = drawn ∪ the mode's static list), `hiddenBossId`, `bossRound`, `hiddenRound`, `spRound`,
`combatMode` (`'client'` | `'server'`), `fields[].progress { killed, total, done }` (teammates' progress UI), `paused`
(solo pause, §1.3a),
`players[].autoplay`, `players[].uniteLeft` (UNITE, leakers only: their enemies still standing, uncapped — §4),
`players[].bonds` = `ps.alive ? bondList(gd, ps.bondsView(), { off: offBondCounts(gd, ps) }) : []` — every bond with members, layers or an active tier
(and, last, every bond the mode never activates that the player has members of: `{ bondId, count, active: false, tier: 0, layers, off: true }`,
the strip's grey 本局禁用 disc — bondsMeta.offBondCounts, never in the battle input), the same list
and order as the player's own `m.private bonds` minus `thresholds` / `countsHand` (the client reads those from
bonds.json; an entry whose count holds 调和's +1 carries `harmony: 1` in both lists — the bond popup's 调和 row, DESIGN
§21.26): a teammate watching the player shows it in the bond strip (DESIGN §20.15); `[]` once the player is
eliminated (nobody can watch them; the result screen reads `m.result`'s own bonds), and per phase: `draft { order, turn, picks, skipsLeft, turnDeadline, turnSeconds, untimed }` (BAND_DRAFT),
`sp { family, name, desc, eventId, cards:[{ idx, kind:'bounty'|'item'|'tactic', id, name, desc, tier, descRaw?, coin?,
payout?, rounds?, enemyKey?, count?, price?, team?, tacticKind? }], order, turn, picks:{pid: idx}, taken:{idx: pid}, untimed }`
(SP_DRAFT), `teamLp` / `bossHp {hp,max}` (Final Assault on), `overtimeAt` (最终攻势 / 隐秘核心: ms epoch when the
overtime drain starts; `deadline` = the level's 120 s countdown), `unite { helpers, leakers }` (UNITE).
`players[].status`: INFO_CHECK ready/deciding · drafts ready (picked) / deciding (their turn) / acting (waiting) ·
PREP ready/acting · COMBAT/boss combat/done · UNITE helping/done · others done · `left` / `dead` override.

`m.private` = DESIGN §8.3 exactly (sent per player whenever it changed). `nextEnemies` = the current round's wave
(+ the player's bounty enemies, tag `bounty`; boss rounds: the player's boss field, tag `boss` — the leader's entry with its
spawn tile `start`, where the boss-field prep shows it —, + its bounties).

Bond layers in the views (DESIGN §20.15): from the end of COMBAT (`_finishCombat`, every normal result in) until SETTLE,
`m.private bonds` and `m.public players[].bonds` add the finished battle's IN_BATTLE gains (`PlayerState.pendingLayerGains`
= the result's `layerGains`; `bondsMeta.bondsWithGains`: floored, at most up to `BOND_LAYER_CAP`, like the settlement), so
the strip keeps the layers the battle reached through the COMBAT_END pause and the 联防. The 联防 field fights with the
same counts (its input's `bonds` come from `bondsView()`, PlayerState.battleInput `reached`; since 0.1.3). `ps.bonds` /
`ps.layers` (rules, `activatedLayers`) are untouched; SETTLE clears the pending gains as it adds them to `ps.layers`
(once); the next round start clears them too.

`m.field` = `{ fieldId, kind, rect, stageId, units, live }`; during prep `g.watch 'n:<pid>'` returns that board
with `prep: true` and sends it again when the board changes (GitHub #87).

**`b.snap` / `b.ev` game time**: every frame is `{ t: '<type>', … }`, so the snapshot's game time (DESIGN `b.snap.t`)
is sent as **`gt`** (game seconds); `b.ev` carries the same `gt`. The client reads `gt` (`render/interp.js frameTime`,
used by `normalizeSnapshot`). Legacy server-run mode only: client-side combat sends no `b.snap` / `b.ev`.

`m.result` (unicast to every human, `playerId` = the recipient) = `{ victory, roundsPassed, hiddenReached,
hiddenCleared, reason: 'victory'|'defeat'|'eliminated'|'abandoned'|'error', teamLp (merged Final Assault LP, null before
it; players[].lp are the alive players' shares), modeId, difficulty, stageId, bossId,
hiddenBossId, seed, durationMs, players:[{ playerId, seat, name, isBot, left, alive, victory (the team won AND this
player was still in at the end), roundsPassed,
eliminatedRound, lp, bandId, lineup:[{ id, golden, tier, row, col, items }], bonds, stats:{ dmgDealt, kills, leaks, gold,
refreshes, merges, itemsEquipped, bossDamage, activatedLayers, lpLost, perfectRounds }, title:{ id, name, picId, text }|null,
trophies, reward }] }`. Trophies and 卫戍认证 follow each row's OWN rounds passed (research 06 §6 / §10.4): the
Hidden-Core trophy row only for the players still in when it was cleared — a teammate eliminated or departed earlier
gets the table value of its own rounds. `onEnd(summary)` receives the same object (without `t`, plus `errors`).

`m.emote { playerId, id }`: `id` must be one of `shared/constants.js EMOTES` (`BAD_MSG` otherwise, also when `handle()`
is called without protocol validation); 1 per second per player (`RATE`).

Tickers (`m.ticker { text, id, type, priority, playerId }`) from `config.broadcasts`: SHOP_LEVEL, GOLDEN_CHAR,
CHAR_DAMAGE (per board unit per battle, highest threshold; summons created in battle once per unit type — a client
result may only name the unit types its lineup can field, fields.js validateClientResult), BOSS_HIT (20/50/80 % of the
current leader per player, each threshold once per boss round: the player's damage to that round's shared pool,
`SharedBossPool.byPlayer`, over its size — the Final Assault and the Hidden Core count apart, while `stats.bossDamage`,
the result's 领袖伤害, adds both up; the browser's strip, which plays its queue 5.2 s per line, drops a BOSS_HIT line
once the round it came in is over, and a player's newer BOSS_HIT line of the round replaces their older one, queued or
on screen — public/js/ui/ticker.js `tickerLineLive`, `tickerSupersedes`), CHAR_GIFT (to the receiver only), plus
CUSTOM texts (eliminations, 联防, hidden core — the match-flow notices at `FLOW_TICKER_PRIORITY` 25 [ASSUMED], content
`ticker()` lines at 0). The strip queues by `priority`, highest first and first in first out among equals (research 06
§9.2 "The highest priority wins": BOSS_HIT 30 > CHAR_DAMAGE 20 > SHOP_LEVEL 11 > GOLDEN_CHAR 2 > CHAR_GIFT 1;
`enqueueTickerLines`); the line on screen is never cut short, and past 4 queued lines the lowest priority's oldest goes.
Until 0.1.1 the queue was first in, first out: the boss prep's shop-level lines held a Final Assault milestone until its
round was over. The official 1 s `broadcastBeginDelay` is not modelled.

## 6. Testing & tools

* `test/match/lobby-integration.test.js` 的联机轮选使用固定种子 `69`，覆盖 AI 先选走默认策略的情况（GitHub #144）。模拟玩家从当前公开选牌结果中选择未被占用的策略，并断言请求成功；不依赖拒绝后的超时分配。单人和联机用例均通过 `b.start` 确认战斗开始，避免瞬间结束的模拟战斗被公开状态节流而漏掉 `COMBAT` 阶段。

* `test/match/fakeBattle.js` — scriptable DESIGN §5.1 Battle (`FakeBattle.script = (battle) => plan`); inject with
  `new Match({ …, BattleClass: FakeBattle })`.
* `test/match/harness.js` — `makeMatch(opts)` (virtual scheduler, captured frames, `drive()` for human decisions,
  `toPrep(r)`, `checkInvariants(m)`, `give()/giveItem()` scenario helpers).
* `VirtualScheduler({ instantCombat })`: `advance(ms)`, `runNext()`, `runUntil(pred)`, `runAll()`; with
  `instantCombat` (default) battles run synchronously, so a full match takes milliseconds of wall time.
* Suites: pool, board, economy, merge, bonds, draft, combat (FakeBattle), finalAssault, connection, meta, waves,
  results, fullmatch (fullmatch*.test.js, parallel files, runner fullmatchRun.js — REAL sim: solo × 4 difficulties, co-op
  2/3/4 incl. AI, 20 seeds each; `MATCH_SEEDS=n` to change),
  fuzz (random valid-shaped intents + connection churn), lobby-integration (real server + sockets), realtime (the real
  server + lobby + Match with RealScheduler and the REAL sim: 2 scripted websocket humans + 2 AI from the room to the
  prep of round 4 — drafts, 机变, buying/placing, combat snapshots `gt`, watching, 联防, throttled m.public), bot (field
  model, layout planner, rehearsal side-effect freedom, economy/bench regression).
  `node --test test/match/*.test.js`
* `node tools/matchrun.mjs --mode coop --difficulty HARD --players 4 --seeds 20` — per-round balancing summary / aggregate
  (`--check` audit, `--errors` per-source error table, `--lp N` / `--layers N` to reach late rounds — the boost stops at
  999 per bond —, `--rehearsal N`).
* `node tools/botbench.mjs --configs solo:HARD,coop4:HARD --seeds 40 --jobs 4 --json new.json` — the AI player's
  outcomes (wins, rounds passed, LP left, leaks per round, bounties taken / leaked and the kill-chance calibration,
  merges, board value, bond tiers, layers, elites) and its decision time per prep (wall clock and CPU, p50 / p95, the
  layout rehearsal apart); `--compare old.json new.json` prints the A/B tables (the same seeds on two builds).
* `node tools/balance.mjs --mode multi --difficulty NORMAL` — the competent-board difficulty model (docs/BALANCE.md):
  per round leaks / LP after 联防 / clear time of representative boards against the real waves, boss damage by 150 s
  and kill time; `--tuning off` (research numbers), `--legacy-time`, `--profile weak|strong`, `--bots N`, `--json`.
  Tests: `test/match/balance.test.js` (tuning layer, model), `test/match/followups.test.js`.

## 7. Assumptions (all documented in module headers)
* Unite helper choice: `unite.js helperOrder` (§4; selection units > active bond > standing units > seat, the pair
  units > active bond > Σ active layers > standing > seat; the ranks marked 存疑 in PRTS). Unite enemies re-enter with
  their original stats on the official 联防 spawn timing (waves.js `buildUniteWave`, DATA.md §15 #22).
* A manual refresh while frozen keeps the new slots frozen until the next round start.
* A level-up opens the new level's extra slots at once — empty, with no card drawn into them (official footage, GitHub
  #332: bilibili BV1AXwuzdEys 1:39, a 1→2 upgrade with the new slot visible and empty; the official texts only ever say
  「升级后将出现更多的商品栏位」/「增加刷新栏位」) — and keeps the cards shown. The empty slots fill on the next roll (a manual
  refresh or the round start), like every unfrozen slot; the shop draws an empty slot as a bare frame, never 已招募. 0.2.0
  drew a card into each new slot (community report item 19, one uncorroborated remark): reverted in 0.2.2.
* Buying a second copy of an equipped normal item merges into the golden item in the hand (not equipped).
* Promotions by effects (升华, 博士投影) keep the equipment; merges return it; 突变细胞's transformation returns it (the
  cell included) before its new operator is gained into the 整备区 — the carrier's tile is left empty (official footage,
  DESIGN §21.1).
* An elite merged in a round is a new piece: its per-piece round counters start at 0 (`pieceRoundCount`), so an elite
  拉普兰德 fires +8 on its own first manual refresh of the round even when its copies already fired (GitHub #169; the
  owner's decision of 2026-10-06 — a newly merged elite counts as a new 拉普兰德; until 0.2.0 it kept the highest count of
  its copies). A 拉普兰德 bought after selling one in the same round is a new copy and fires on its own first refresh
  ("获得该干员后"; each such +4 costs 3 + 1 refresh − 1 refund and needs her in the shop).
* Chess granted by effects need a free pool copy unless `requirePool: false` (then they hold 0 copies).
* Boss-round `local` pack spawns (boss parts) all spawn; content scripts (bosses.js) decide their behaviour.
* The Final Assault ends as a defeat when every field finished with the boss pool above 0 (boss escaped).
* The 999 layer cap holds for every prep-side gain too (the client only shows the in-battle clamp; the scene server's
  code is not in the client — research 11 §1.2). A 限伤-cancelled hit shows no number; a part's damage passed on to its
  leader (Battle.loseHp) meets the limit like a hit (research 11 §2.3).
* Combat limits are real seconds (× 2 in game seconds) — see §3; research 00-INDEX §8 #10 assumed game seconds.
* Emotes faster than 1/s answer `RATE`.
* 中途退出 = elimination at once (research); a quitter's operators already fighting in a shared field (联防, boss
  field) finish that battle, its LP already merged into the team LP stays there.
* After the LP merge (Final Assault) the per-player LP shown is a share of the team LP ∝ the LP each player brought in.
* A 联防 helper's operator knocked out at the end of its own combat is deployed and forced out at once (PRTS 强制退场,
  §4) with HP 0, and redeploys after its full redeploy time: no timer carry (the official setup carries only hp / tech
  per operator), forced out before `battleStart` (its timer re-read after it, so 征召's −50 % applies; 征召's row check
  does not count it), no knock-out hooks (`kill`, 'killed' deaths) a second time.
* A merge completed after the prep (SETTLE effects) keeps its reward offer for the next prep; its elite goes where a prep
  merge's would — onto the tile of a consumed deployed copy (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 "若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，则发送至作战区
  对应位置"), else to the hand, overflowing into temp (temp pieces that arrive after the prep wait through the next prep).
