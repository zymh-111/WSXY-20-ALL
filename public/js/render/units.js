// render/units.js — per-unit views for battle units and prep pieces (DESIGN §9).
//
// UnitView = shadow sprite (shadow layer) + body container (depth-sorted unit layer: elite aura, Spine actor or
// the avatar-in-rarity-diamond fallback) + HUD container (bar layer: HP bar with delayed "ghost" damage, SP bar
// with ready glow / draining skill bar, tier chip, status icons, blocked marker). The fallback shows at once and
// cross-fades to the Spine model when it has loaded (the game never blocks on Spine); an optional local-client model
// (assets.js spineEntry `fallback`, DESIGN §13: 灼热源石虫 / 炽焰源石虫) falls back to the web model first; that web alias
// (the plain 源石虫) is drawn tinted toward the slug's own colours (ALIAS_TINT). A model that failed or timed out is
// loaded again after SPINE_RETRY_MS (bounded), and `retryAssets()` re-resolves a view's picture and model when the
// asset manifest arrives after the view was built or the tab is shown again (render/app.js; public issue #8 item 5:
// after a reload whose manifest was slow or failed, every operator stayed the image-less placeholder for good); a load
// begun while the tab was hidden and still in flight SPINE_STUCK_MS after it is shown again is started again
// (assets.js spine.restart: GitHub #68, such a load may never settle — its view stayed the placeholder). Every
// bar is a tinted Texture.WHITE sprite, so HUDs batch into few draw calls.
//
// Placement: feet anchored at world (x, y, z); scale = camera px-per-tile at the feet × UNIT.modelScale, so
// chibis shrink with distance like the original. An enemy's model is also scaled by its official prefab factor
// (enemies.json `modelScale`, user playtest #6 item 9: the official battle prefab shrinks e.g. 威龙 to 0.16 / 0.27 of
// the standard size — tools/build-data.mjs MODEL_SCALES; `enemyModelScale`). Operators and summons face their deploy direction `dir`
// (research 09 §1.2, DESIGN §3: UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT, chosen with the direction wheel; UnitInfo / piece `dir`, else
// the legacy `facing` ±1): the Back model for UP (when one exists, research 07 §5.5), the Front model for RIGHT and
// DOWN, mirrored for LEFT; the orange ground wedge "›" of prep board pieces points along `dir` (rotated on the ground
// plane). `setDir(dir)` re-orients a live view (swapping Front ⇄ Back without a fallback flash). Enemies flip by the
// sign of their horizontal velocity (with hysteresis). A dead or knocked-out operator facing UP falls and lies with its
// Front model — 131 of the 135 Back skeletons have no Die clip (GitHub issue #25: the Back model went on with its
// attack loop under the redeploy ring) — and stands up again with the Back model (`_wantsBack`, `_syncModel`).
//
// Knocked-out operators (user playtest #4 item 9, b.snap `down`): `setDown([id, respawnAt, respawnTime, state, row,
// col])` keeps a dead operator on the tile it lies on (row / col: where it fell, or its home — sim Battle._layBody,
// player report F5 after 0.1.0) in its knocked-down pose — the Spine Die clip played once and held on its last
// frame (the collapsed / kneeling pose with closed eyes; the Front model's for one facing UP unless its Back skeleton has its own Die clip, see above), slightly
// greyed — with a redeploy ring above its head:
// a dark disc, a mint arc filling as the respawn timer runs and the seconds left; once the timer is done and it still
// waits, a full amber ring with "DP" (not enough DP) or a red ring with "!" (its tile is taken). `onDeploy` (the
// redeploy) plays the deploy clip and restores the normal look; `setDown(null)` on a dead view lets it fade out.
// An operator that enters a battle already knocked out (联防, user playtest #5 item 2: sim 'die' reason 'forcedExit')
// goes down with `die(true)`: straight to the held end of the clip, no fall.
// Enemy modes (the `form` of a sim fx — shared/protocol.js fxForm — → `setForm(form, fx)`): 掠海漂移体 dropping to 爬行模式
// (user playtest #5 item 1) plays its skeleton's 'Change' clip once, then the crawl set (*_02); 暴鸰 flies on without its
// bomb (*_2) after the drop (feedback D4); 转译基底's forms, the 逐火 embers, 再生's puppet, the leaders' 重生 and 守墓石像
// likewise (user report after 0.1.0) — FORMS; an operator's form is a 傀儡师's 替身 (GitHub issue #44). A view built later
// (`info.form` = UnitInfo `form`, the sim's current form, through render/app.js renderInfo) starts in the mode; a dead
// view keeps the form it died in (`_dieForm`) for a model built while it lies down.
// Element gauges (b.snap `elem` → sample `el` / `elFill` / `elUntil` / `elDur`), the official form (PRTS 元素: "模型
// 下部会显示对应的元素图标，并以白条显示剩余的元素值"; enemies "小尺寸图标（不显示元素图标，仅根据元素种类改变背景色）"): a row
// right under the unit's own HP / SP bars and inside their span — the element's disc at the left (operators with its
// glyph, enemies smaller and plain) and a white bar of the remaining 元素值 (1 − fill) that runs out right to left
// like the HP bar above it; during a 爆发冷却 the bar refills over the cooldown (PRTS: "元素条显示缓慢恢复至上限"), drawn in
// the element's colour with the disc pulsing [ASSUMED look], so a refill never reads as 元素值 still left while the
// burst's stun / damage / 凋亡 ticks hit the unit. User playtest #6 (report 11): the v2.3 ring right of the bars sat on
// the next operator's tier chip and bars (drawn under them) and read as that operator's gauge, a shrinking ring reads
// like a filling progress ring, and its refill was the same white as the 元素值 left. The disc comes from the hudRings
// atlas, the bars are tinted Texture.WHITE sprites; built on first use and hidden when idle.
//
// ItemView renders hand items as a floating icon plate; DeviceView renders battle devices (crates) as 3D boxes
// with an HP bar once damaged.
//
// Cost control (low-end devices): a unit whose body is outside the viewport (`ctx.viewport()`, with a margin) is not
// animated or drawn at all (its clock catches up, ≤ 0.5 s, when it comes back); `opts.lod: 'idle'` (the enemy preview
// pen: idle loops only) animates through the impostor atlas every 3rd frame; under the view's adaptive load level
// (`ctx.loadLevel()` 1–3, app.js) small / far units (< ~56 px per tile) animate every 2nd frame, and from level 2 on
// every unit does.
//
// Picking is by tile (render/pick.js, user playtest #4 item 1): views carry no hit shapes; `bounds()` is the drawn body's
// screen rect for tooltips and overlays (view.pieceScreenRect). A dragged (lifted) item plate is drawn centred on its
// ground point, i.e. on the pointer (render/app.js).

 * model-independent: no store to that field exists anywhere in the binary except the constructor.
 *
 * `0.35` is that constant in the client's own (character) space, whose unit is the standard battle-prefab scale **0.27**

 *
 * **No per-model term** — (a) the binary never rewrites the offset; (b) the battle prefabs carry no per-model vertical
 * correction for flyers (their `Graphic` node sits at local (0,0,0), or at the (0,−0.2,−0.06) their ground-unit prefab
