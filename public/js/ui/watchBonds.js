// Whose bonds the bond strip shows (DESIGN §20.15, user report after playtest #6: "观看队友时…盟约栏应该变成当前队友的
// 盟约以及他的层数") — pure helpers for the game screen (screens/game.js), the strip and its popup (ui/bondStrip.js).
//
// The strip follows the player whose field / half the camera shows:
//   * the own board (prep) and the own battle → your own bonds (m.private bonds);
//   * a teammate's board in prep (前往查看, research 09 §3.1 "their board, read-only, including their pen and bonds"), a
//     teammate's battle watched after the own one ended, the field an eliminated player auto-observes → THAT player's
//     bonds (m.public players[].bonds);
//   * a shared field (联防 'u', the Final Assault / Hidden Core pair 'b1' / 'b2') — no source shows the strip there; this
//     rule was settled by the user (DESIGN §20.15): the player holding the half the ‹ › pill points at ("你自己" → yours, "👁 name" → theirs). On 全景 (or an
//     empty half, "无人在家"): yourself when you fight on that field; a viewer who does not (a 联防 leaker, an eliminated
//     spectator) never sees their own bonds there — the teammate they picked with 前往查看 (official observing targets a
//     player: ObserveUp / DeadAutoObDn { obIndex }), else the field's first player (helper 1 / the pair's first seat;
//     the official non-helper pill reads "‹ 👁 helper# ›"). 前往查看 of a player on a two-half field also moves the
//     camera to their half (playerLayer), so the pill and the strip name the same player.
// In battle the layers are live: the local simulation of the battle on screen (the own one, a teammate's display
// replica — battle/runner.js state().bondLayers, absolute counts ≤ BOND_LAYER_CAP) is laid over the view's start-of-
// round counts; the server's views add the finished normal battle's gains from the end of COMBAT until the settlement
// (server/match/bondsMeta.js bondsWithGains), so the counts never fall back during 联防.
// A detail card's bond chips follow the UNIT's owner instead (detailBondOwner: a shared field shows both halves' units
// whoever the strip follows), and a bond popup carries the player it was opened for (toggleBond / popupView): the
// strip's owner, or the chip's — its entry, member list and "👁 name" label always belong to that one player.
