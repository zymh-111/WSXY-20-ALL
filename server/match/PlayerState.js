// server/match/PlayerState.js — authoritative per-player state + every prep intent handler (DESIGN §6.2).
//
// Handlers validate → mutate → recompute bonds → mark the private view dirty. They never throw on bad input; they
// return `{ ok: true }` or `{ error: ERR.*, detail? }`. Rules (research 00-INDEX §3–§4, 01 A1, 04 §2):
//   * Hand (整备区) 10 slots filled right→left, temp (临时整备区) 5 slots. A full hand refuses buys and reward picks —
//     also one that would complete a merge at once (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §手牌区 "例如招募/购入等通常情况下会增加手牌的操作";
//     GitHub #82) — and withdrawals, except one whose own summon stack frees a slot. Passive gains (merge results,
//     grants, returned equipment) overflow into temp, and a free hand slot pulls them back in at once, right→left
//     (_fillHandFromTemp at every recompute: "常规手牌区出现空位时自动移入"); temp blocks Ready ("直到溢出情况排除才可开始
//     进行作战").
//     A temp piece is resolved (chess sold back to the pool, items destroyed, summon stacks removed — they come back at
//     the next round start, grantTokensFor) at the deadline of the
//     first prep in which the player could act on it (tempDue): a piece that overflowed during a prep before Ready
//     expires at that prep's end; one that arrived after Ready, at the prep end (<休整期结束时> grants), in COMBAT /
//     SETTLE (battle-result grants, merges, returned equipment) or at the next round start / 机变 stays visible and
//     usable (move to a free hand slot, place, equip, destroy, sell) through the NEXT prep — nothing is destroyed before
//     the player saw it in a prep ("处于临时整备区的调度资源，在进入下一回合后会自动销毁").
//   * Board: own region rows 9–12 × cols 2–10, legality from the stage legend (board.js); deploy cap 8 (+effects);
//     tokens (placeable summons) don't use deploy slots. Board↔hand swaps are always allowed. In a boss round the
//     legality reads the player's half of the boss field (Match.deployFieldOf → board.js field 'bossL' / 'bossR',
//     user playtest #5 item 7); board coordinates are unchanged. A terrain change (terrain 机变 cards, content
//     overrides) or a change of the deploy field withdraws the pieces left on tiles they may no longer occupy (hand,
//     overflow temp; summons back onto their stack) — see _evictIllegal.
//   * Shop: per-level chess slots + item slot, copy-weighted rolls from the SHARED pool (pool.js); refresh 1 (free
//     refreshes first), one toggle freezes all unsold slots until the next round start (a manual refresh while frozen
//     rerolls everything and the new slots stay frozen), level-up price = base − rounds elapsed (floor 0).
//   * Merge: 3 normal copies (风丸 2) on board/hand/temp → 1 elite; equipment returns to the hand; a
//     reward offer of 3 different free chess of tier min(level+1, 6) is queued (never one operator twice — user
//     playtest #6 item 19; a short tier tops up from the tier below; pick 1, expires at prep end; an offer earned
//     after the prep — SETTLE / Final Assault effects — is kept for the next prep). Where the elite goes (PRTS
//     卫戍协议/帮助 "发送1名【精锐】状态的该干员至手牌区（若消耗已部署至作战区的干员，则发送至作战区对应位置）", user
//     playtest #6 follow-up): when a consumed copy stood on the board, onto that copy's tile with its facing (of several,
//     the one that deploys first — board.js mergeTile, [ASSUMED]); it replaces a deployed copy, so the deploy count
//     never grows, and it gets its own summon stack (grantTokensFor). Otherwise to the hand, overflow temp — also
//     outside PREP (a SETTLE merge's elite waits in temp for the next prep).
//   * Per-piece round counters (pieceRoundCount, piece.meta.round): an operator's own counts of the current round
//     (拉普兰德: the manual refreshes she witnessed — player feedback after 0.1.0); a new piece starts at 0, an elite
//     merged this round too (a new 拉普兰德 — GitHub #169, the owner's decision of 2026-10-06).
//   * Transformations (transformChess, 突变细胞 — PRTS 备注 "生效时，原干员销毁，获得一名高一阶的随机初始干员"): a destroy
//     followed by a gain. The carrier leaves wherever it stands (a board tile is freed, the deploy count drops), its
//     equipment — the cell included — returns to the hand first (overflow temp), then the new chess is gained like any
//     other (acquireChess: hand, overflow temp, the no-room rule; a merge it completes puts the elite on a consumed
//     deployed copy's tile — never the carrier's —, else in the hand). Official footage: the tile is empty at the next
//     prep and the new operator waits in the 整备区 (pointed out in PR #2).
//   * Items: equip max 2 (a 3rd replaces the equipped item the player picks — g.equip replaceUid, the oldest when
//     absent; equipped items are otherwise locked: g.destroy refuses them),
//     2 identical normal items (hand/temp/equipped) merge into the golden item in the hand, items are never sold
//     (destroy for 0). consume-on-equip items resolve through the effect registry and never take a slot — on a full
//     carrier they still replace (destroy) the picked item first, leaving a free slot (PRTS 帮助, GitHub #263).
//   * Tokens (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助 §战斗部署, user playtest #6): placing an owner with manually deployable summons
//     (tokens.json `placeable`: 赫默's 医疗探机 and 巫恋's 诅咒娃娃 with their S2, 凯瑟琳's 爬行号·防护单元, 海嗣 / 狼群 /
//     流形) sends one stack (deployLimit copies — 凯瑟琳 2) to the hand, placed by hand like any piece (no deploy slot);
//     withdrawing/selling/merging the owner removes its tokens (an elite that takes a merged copy's tile gets a fresh
//     stack of its own, like any deployment), moving it on the board (also when a summon dragged onto
//     it swaps it away) sends its placed summons back onto their stack ("移动干员时，其所属召唤物全部退场并重置至手牌区");
//     a summon stack removed from temp at a prep deadline comes back at the next round start (startRound tops every
//     board owner's summons up to the deploy limit, "干员所属召唤物会于下一回合返还"). In battle a skill's summon takes its
//     tile when the skill fires (sim/content/tokens.js dockSkillSummons). A summon whose text reads "只能部署在召唤者
//     攻击范围内" (tokens.json `ownerRange`: the tacticians' 狼群 / 流形 — their tactical point; player report #9 after
//     0.1.0) only goes on a tile of its owner's attack range (_legal / summonRange: the loadout's grid rotated by the
//     owner's facing); a swap with its owner is checked from the owner's new tile, and one an in-place re-orientation
//     (or a promotion) leaves outside goes back onto its stack (recompute → _liftOutOfRange) [ASSUMED: kept when still
//     inside]. A re-orientation that would leave such a summon with no stack and no free hand / temp slot is refused
//     (HAND_FULL); elsewhere (a promotion, an owner moved with no room) it leaves the board and its stack comes back at
//     the next round start (grantTokensFor) — no out-of-range placement reaches the battle.
//   * Facing (DESIGN §3, research 09 §1.2): every board piece has `dir` ∈ UP|RIGHT|DOWN|LEFT (server/sim/dir.js), set
//     by g.move {…, dir} (absent ⇒ RIGHT) and kept across rounds. g.move onto the piece's OWN tile re-orients it in
//     place; a swap keeps the occupant's dir; a piece put on the board by an effect (a merge elite taking a consumed
//     copy's tile) keeps that tile's dir, anything else defaults to RIGHT (`pieceDir`). g.art {…, dir} rotates the
//     Art's range (画卷 1-1: its tile + the tile in front).
//   * Operator loadout (DESIGN §16): the human's checked `seat.loadout` ({ [baseChessId]: { skill, module } }, entries
//     equal to the defaults dropped) is re-checked against this match's data (shared/protocol.js checkLoadout; a
//     mismatch falls back to the defaults) and kept frozen; bots always use the defaults. Match.setLoadout may replace
//     it during INFO_CHECK only. battleInput() resolves every chess unit to `skillIndex` + `moduleId` (resolveLoadout:
//     normal chess → moduleId null, elite → uniEquipId | 'none'); m.private exposes `loadout`.
//   * 潜能 / 练度 (0.2.2, the owner's decision of 2026-10-08 「调配干员里自己设置吧，默认满潜满加成」): the human's checked
//     `seat.ops` ({ [charId]: { potential, cultivate } }, defaults dropped) is re-checked (checkLoadoutOps) and changed
//     with the loadout; a missing entry — and every operator of a bot — is 潜能 6, 精英2 Lv.60. battleInput() states both
//     for every operator the player owns (a chess fielded as itself, an owned 自选 pick: `cultivationFor`), never for a
//     补位 stand-in or a prototype pick (shared/potential.js cultivationOf); the 自选 summons' hand count follows the
//     owner's potential (望's 棋子). m.private exposes `ops`; the scouting views carry each unit's `potential` / `cultivate`.
//   * Operator ownership (0.2.0 补位, the approved plan — owner's decision 2026-10-05): the human's `seat.notOwned` (base
//     chess ids marked 未持有 on the 干员持有 screen) is re-checked against this match's data (shared/protocol.js
//     checkNotOwned + a stand-in record in data/backups.json) and fixed for the match (`standIns`; bots own every
//     operator). A piece of such a chess — normal or elite, wherever it is — keeps the chess's identity for the rules
//     (bonds, 特质, tier, price, sell price, merge: every rule that reads gd.chess) and is its official stand-in
//     (`fieldRecord` = gd.standIn: body, stats, range, position, skills / talents / module — the backup selection, the
//     loadout never applies to it, "对于补位干员其技能不可更改"): battleInput marks it `standIn: true`, placeClass /
//     summon range / the bots' range read the stand-in record, it makes no summons (none of the 17 stand-ins has one),
//     and what shows it shows the stand-in (the owner's recall of the official mode, 2026-10-06): the scouting views
//     (board and bench), the m.result lineup (`standInFor`), the elite / gift tickers' names. m.private exposes `standIns`.
//   * 自选编队 (0.2.0 DIY, the owner's decisions of 2026-10-05; player/diy.js): the human's `seat.diy` picks are re-checked
//     against this match's data and kits and fixed for the match (`diy`; bots none [ASSUMED]). With picks, `this.gd` is the
//     player's data view: the slotted slots' ids (normal and elite) are the composed 自选 records, so the player's piece
//     of a slot is the operator for every rule (name, class, position, bonds from its factions, no 特质, the pick's skill
//     and module; tier, price, sell price and the 3 → elite merge are the slot's). Each slotted piece has its own stock
//     (8 at tier 5, 5 at tier 6 [ASSUMED]; none when every bond of it is banned this match) and joins this player's shop
//     rolls once the 调度中心 reaches the slot's level; it never enters the shared pool. battleInput carries `diy` (the
//     pick), m.private exposes `diy` (and `diyBanned`), the scouting views draw the operator with its pick.
//
// Code layout: this file keeps the constructor (the per-player state fields); the methods live in
// server/match/player/, one module per concern, and are installed on PlayerState.prototype below in a fixed order,
// with the descriptors of class methods (non-enumerable getters included; `this` is the player state):
//   basics.js     seat flags and counts (getters), the temp due prep, the operator loadout, the deploy map and the
//                 eviction after a terrain / deploy-field change, dirty
//   pieces.js     piece bookkeeping: new pieces, lookup, detach / stow, per-piece round counters, pool copies,
//                 summon stacks
//   acquire.js    gains and merges: acquireChess / acquireItem, the chess and item merges, promotion,
//                 transformation, reward / item offers
//   economy.js    funds, spending, prep-side layer gains, the shop (prices, rolls) and its intents: buy, refresh,
