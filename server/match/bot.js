// server/match/bot.js — AI player (DESIGN §6.6). Used for AI teammates and "AI 托管" (g.autoplay; a departed human
// is eliminated, Match._quit). Every action goes through the same validated
// PlayerState handlers a human uses; randomness only from the match's bot rng (deterministic per seed).
//
// It reads only what a player can see: its own state, the shop, the shared pool's copies left, the teammates' bond
// strips, and the round's enemy preview (composition and routes, research 06 §4.3 "查看当前回合即将迎击的敌方单位").
//
// Prep routine (botPrep):
//   1. take a pending reward offer (merge progress, bond synergy, tier)
//   2. economy. The bond plan (bondPlan): a focus core bond — owned members, members the shop can still bring at this
//      level, banked layers, last round's focus (commit instead of flip-flopping), minus a teammate's main core bond
//      (its bond strip; the shop pool is shared) — and a second bond (most owned members, next threshold within
//      reach). Keepers: the deployed operators, focus / second members, chess of tier ≥ shop level − 1. Sell bench
//      chess that neither make the lineup nor build toward something (a pair whose third copy can still come, a
//      keeper, an elite; ≤ BENCH_BUDGET spare units, pairs first), buy toward a full board (the deploy cap is 8 from
//      round 1), complete every merge it can afford — before a level-up can spend the funds —, level the 调度中心 on a
//      curve (free levels always; the −1/round discount is waited for early), then spend the rest (leftover funds are
//      lost at prep end; a band that keeps them, 坎诺特, holds its interest capital back — fundsReserve): with a full
//      board a purchase must be merge progress or a lineup upgrade AND worth more than the refreshes its price would
//      pay for — refreshValue: Σ over the held pairs of P(a refresh shows the third copy, the shop's copy-weighted odds
//      over the shared pool) × MERGE_HIT (an elite plus the merge's free pick of the next tier) — else it refreshes. A
//      third copy it cannot afford freezes the shop for the next round (maybeFreeze). Purchase scores: merge progress >
//      bond thresholds (focus, second) > role needs (blockers, anti-air when the wave flies, one or two healers) >
//      tier and armour fit (the share of a dealer's damage the round's DEF / RES lets through, effDps; an attack on every
//      enemy in range — 阵法术师 / 轰击术师 — counts double, splash and chain a little, CROWD). A merge that
//      consumes a deployed copy leaves the elite on that copy's tile (PRTS 卫戍协议/帮助, PlayerState._mergeChess):
//      nothing here assumes it in the hand — steps 3–4 plan it like any owned unit (kept, moved or benched).
//   3. lineup: the deployed set maximizes unit value (tier, elite, items, armour fit) + activated bond tiers (exact
//      counting via computeBonds; every deployed focus member counts toward the next threshold) + composition
//      (chooseLineup: greedy seed + swap hill-climbing).
//   4. placement (planLayout): the round's routes are traced over the own board from the enemy preview (ground
//      routes on the stage's device-aware ground paths, flying routes through their checkpoints; 近地悬浮 enemies walk
//      the ground path but count as flyers) and weighted by their enemies; an exposure model (tile time × DPS of the
//      covering units against the round's DEF / RES, blocker hold time, flyers only for anti-air) is maximized
//      greedily — blockers first, then damage dealers by DPS, then healers — over every
//      (legal tile, direction) pair of the server's deploy map (no 深水区). A MELEE operator is planned on the ground
//      tiles, where it blocks — except one whose trait reads 「可以放置于远程位」 (歌蕾蒂娅, 崖心, 见行者, any module:
//      placeClass 'all', shared/highGround.js), which takes a 高台 whose range covers the enemy road, else the ground
//      (owner 2026-10-04 for the 高台 preference, 2026-10-05 for who may use one). It stays a blocker in the lineup
//      (basePositionClass). A blocker whose range grid is its own tile only (range 0-1: 角峰, 古米, 泡泡, 折桠, 菲莱, 蛇屠箱,
//      塞雷娅, 余) is planned on a free tile of the enemy road first: off it nothing is blocked or hit. Each unit's range grid — the one it is
//      deployed with, rangeRec (loadoutRecord attackRangeGrid) — is rotated per direction (DESIGN §3; RIGHT is tried first
//      and kept on ties, so symmetric ranges and melee units whose front adds nothing stay facing the gates), so
//      ranged units turn toward the enemy path tiles they cover best and blockers toward the road; on 气流 tiles
//      (act2 m01 blowers) the DPS is scaled by the blower ATK bonus of that direction (with / against / across). The last
//      arrangement of a prep REHEARSES up to m.botRehearsal distinct layout variants with the real Battle (rehearsal
//      seed, no meta dispatch, board restored exactly) and keeps the one with the fewest leaks. The default plan is
//      placed first; Match steps the rehearsal in wall-clock-bounded slices (botPrepBegin → job.run → botPrepEnd) so
//      whole simulated battles never block the server's event loop. The prep routine itself is sliced the same way:
//      botPrepBeginSteps / botPrepEndSteps (and planLayoutSteps, arrangeSteps, createRehearsalSteps) are step
//      generators that yield between whole actions (never with a transient board) — the same actions in the same
//      order as the one-shot functions (runSteps), hence the same rng draws and decisions.
//      The summon cards of the placed operators (赫默's 医疗探机, 伺夜's 狼群 …; user playtest #6) are placed after
//      them on the best remaining tiles — a tactician's 援军 (狼群 / 流形) only on a tile of its owner's attack range
//      (its tactical point: PlayerState.summonRange, the server's legality; player report #9 after 0.1.0) —, 凯瑟琳's
//      支援装置 next to the best operator no device faces yet, facing it. Legality is the server's: the bot plans on the deploy map (board.js legalTiles) and
//      a tile g.move refuses is skipped for the next best one.
//   5. items by what they do (itemTarget): equipment on the strongest deployed damage dealers (survival items on
//      blockers, bond signature items on a member), 信标 on a bench single, 拟态物质 on a pair, 博士投影 (both
//      qualities) on the strongest normal operator, 突变细胞 on the least valuable normal single below 6阶 (cellTarget:
//      never an elite or a pair member; the operator its transformation gains joins the bench — the buy loop's bench
//      shed leaves a piece gained since the last prep alone, rememberOwned — and steps 3–4 of the next prep deploy it
//      like any owned unit), bond items on a focus member; Arts (useArt): 画卷 copies the most valuable
//      deployed operator, 教鞭 / “神秘顾客” are used after a perfect battle and kept otherwise (consume-on-equip items /
//      Arts only with a handler)
//   6. resolve the temp slots (a 突变细胞 left there — it comes back after every transformation — gets a hand slot made
//      for it, makeHandRoom, instead of being destroyed), keep one hand slot free (freeHandSlot: a kept bounty Art goes
//      before a chess on a bot's own seat, never on a human's seat under AI 托管), then Ready.
// Strategy (botPickBand): weighted by starting LP among the offered bands; never one whose mechanic rides on a bond the
// mode switches off (gd.bandBondIds = bands.json bondIds: the bond its text names in <…> or its blackboards name — 标准's
// 潘格尼尼, 克莱门莎, 玛恩纳; DESIGN §21.26); alone, 老鲤's withheld first-round funds only rarely (× 0.02).
// 机变 (botPickCard): a bounty by its expected payout minus the expected LP lost — bountyKillChance runs the exposure
// model for that one enemy against the own board; a card the board is unlikely to beat wins only when nothing better
// is offered or it pays much more —; tactic cards by what they act on (a 盟誓 / 驰援 card on the own bonds, 升华 …);
// items by tier and use.
// Placement quality (tools/matchrun sweeps, research-faithful waves): the planner beats random layouts by ≈ 8 points
// of kill rate and rehearsal adds ≈ 5 more; see docs/META.md §1.5. Old vs new decisions on the same seeds:
// tools/botbench.mjs.
